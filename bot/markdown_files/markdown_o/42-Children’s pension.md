#Children’s pension
Financial support if you are a child and have lost one or both of your parents.
From 1 January 2024, you can receive a children's pension if you are under the age of 20 and have lost one or both parents.

 If you lost one or both parents before 1 December 2023, you could get child pension if you were

 * under the age of 18 and had lost one or both of your parents
* under the age of 20, have no parents, and are in education or doing an apprenticeship or internship
* under the age of 21, have lost one or both of your parents, are in education or doing an apprenticeship or internship, and the death of one of your parents was due to an occupational injury or occupational illness

 #### **Are you between 18 and 20 years old on 1 January 2024?**

 You may be entitled to children's pension according to new rules. We will contact you at the beginning of 2024 to give you more information about your rights.

 The deceased parent must have been a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme for the last 5 years before their death. In addition, you must be a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme.

 You can receive children’s pension regardless of whether your parents were married, divorced or living together as cohabiting partners.

 If your mother has died and your paternity has not been established, you will be treated in the same way as people who have lost both parents.

 There are increased rates for child pension from 1 January 2024.

 * If you have lost one of your parents, you will receive the national insurance basic amount which currently amounts to NOK  a year.
* If you have lost both of your parents, you will receive 2.25 times the national insurance basic amount, NOK .
* If you have siblings, they will also receive the same amount. The child's pension will not be divided between you.

 The benefit may be lower if the deceased has lived abroad.

 #### Have you received children's pension before 1 January 2024?

 Your childrens's pension will be recalculated according to new rules if it is better for you. If you are paid more under the old rules, you will keep the child's pension as it is.

 The size of your children’s pension will depend on how many siblings you have. If you have no parents, the deceased’s earned pension will also determine how much you receive.

 #### If you have lost one of your parents

 If you do not have any siblings, you will receive 40 per cent of the national insurance basic amount (“G”), which currently amounts to NOK  a year or  a month.

 If you have siblings, the total amount of children’s pension you are each entitled to will be combined and then divided equally among you. You will receive a monthly payment.

 This is how the **total amount** is calculated, which is then divided equally among the siblings:

 * For the eldest child, NAV calculates 40 per cent of the national insurance basic amount (“G”), which currently corresponds to NOK  a year.
* For the remaining siblings, NAV calculates 25 per cent of the national insurance basic amount (“G”) for each child, i.e. NOK  a year.

 #### If you have lost both your parents or have no parents

 If you do not have any siblings, you will receive a pension corresponding to the survivor’s pension you are entitled to after the parent who had the highest earned pension.

 If you have siblings, the total amount of pension you are each entitled to will be combined and then divided equally among you. NAV calculates the **total amount** as follows:  

 * For the eldest child, NAV calculates an amount corresponding to the survivor’s pension you are entitled to after the parent who had the highest earned pension.
* For the second eldest child, NAV calculates 40 per cent of the national insurance basic amount (“G”), which currently corresponds to NOK  a year.
* For the remaining siblings, NAV calculates 25 per cent of the national insurance basic amount (“G”) for each child, i.e. NOK  a year.
* These amounts are added together and then divided equally among the siblings. You will receive a monthly payment.

 If your deceased parent’s period of national insurance cover (i.e. their period of residence in Norway) was shorter than 40 years, you will receive a smaller children’s pension.

 If your deceased parent has accumulated pension rights in a country with which Norway has a social security agreement, you may be entitled to a pension from that country.

 If your parent died as a result of an approved [occupational injury or occupational illness](/yrkesskade/en), your children’s pension will be calculated according to special rules.

 You can receive children's pension up to and including the month you turn 20 years of age.

 If you were granted childen's pension before 1 January 2024 and the death was due to occupational injury or occupational illness, you may be entitled to benefit until you turn 21 years of age.

 If you are under the age of 18, your children’s pension will be paid to your surviving parent. If you have lost both of your parents, the money will be paid to your legal guardian. 

 When you turn 18, the children’s pension can be paid to your (the child’s) bank account, if NAV has received notification of payment to a new bank account number, which you (the child) have signed after you turned 18. Payment to your bank account can then take place from the month in which you turn 18.

 Children’s pension is paid out once a month.

 ### Holiday pay

### Tax deductions

    However, there are restrictions on the right to receive children’s pension abroad for certain groups of people. This applies to the special entitlements in the calculation of pensions for

 * orphaned children of a young disabled person

          You may be entitled to pension payments abroad pursuant to the National Insurance Act.

      ### Moving to Norway

 You can only receive children’s pension if your deceased parent had been a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme for the last 5 years before their death. There are also a number of requirements that you yourself must meet in order to receive the benefit.

 If the deceased had an occupational pension plan, you may be eligible for payments from some of these schemes. If your parent was in work until their death, you should contact their employer for more information.
