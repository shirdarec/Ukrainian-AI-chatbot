#Support for school fees for single parents
Covers expenses related to tuition fees, semester fees and examination fees for single parents  when you are studying and are alone with children.
You can receive support for school fees when you are taking an [education that NAV has approved](https://www.nav.no/skolepenger-enslig/en#education). You can only receive this benefit if you are a single parent.

 Generally, you and the child must live in Norway to qualify for the benefit, and you must have been a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme for the last 5 years. Read more about staying or moving abroad, and exceptions to the membership requirement under [to and from abroad](/skolepenger-enslig/en#to-and-from-abroad).

  To qualify for support, the education you are taking must be necessary and appropriate for you to be able to get a job and support yourself.

 This benefit covers your actual expenses for tuition fees, semester fees and examination fees.  
   
 You can apply to have expenses for learning materials, travel, relocation and extra housing expenses in connection with your education covered by supplemental benefit.

 Support for school fees is granted for one academic year at a time. You can receive support for school fees for as long as education or training is required.  
   
 You can only receive this benefit for as long as you qualify for transitional benefit. This applies regardless of whether you actually receive transitional benefit during this period or not.

 #### Are you receiving or do you intend to apply for transitional benefit?

 You can receive transitional benefit for up to three years. Periods during which you receive benefit will be deducted from this period if you receive support for school fees. This applies if:

 You can have your expenses covered up to a defined upper limit set by the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (“Lånekassen”).
