#Life certificate for pension and disability benefit recipients abroad
NAV may require that you submit a life certificate when you are living abroad and receive pension or disability benefit payments.
The deadline for submitting the life certificate is 2 months from the date NAV sends out the letters. The excact time frame is specified in the letter.

 ### **Can I request an extension?**

 We cannot grant any extensions. NAV has automated routines for sending out and receiving life certificates.

 If you have not submitted your certificate by the date specified, you will receive a reminder with a new date from us. The letter will include the life certificate form.

 Even if you have notified us of a delay, you will receive a reminder from NAV.

 ### **What happens if I do not submit my life certificate?**

 If you do not submit your life certificate in time, or if your form has no attestation or signature, payments will stop after one reminder. We will not stop payments until the new date has expired.

 You must fill in the form, including your name, national identity number and address, and submit the signed and attested form to NAV.

 Submit your signed and attested life certificate to NAV. So far, there is no digital solution for life certificates.

 ### **Use regular mail**

 When you send us the life certificate, please send it using regular letter mail. We cannot accept registered letters, letters send by courier or other types of shipments that require a signature.

 Ordinary e-mail is not a secure channel. For privacy reasons, we cannot accept your life certificate via e-mail.

 NAV sends out life certificates to thousands of recipients of pension and disability benefit every year. If you do not hear from us, it means we have received your life certificate and have approved it. We will contact your if we need more information.

 If we do not receive your certificate, or if it has been delayed in the mail, you will hear from us. You do not need to contact NAV to confirm that we have received your life certificate.

 If you have received the life certificate form from NAV, you must sign it, have it attested and return it. This applies even if you recently confirmed to NAV that you are alive.

 If you submit a life certificate on your own initiative outside of the annual review, you must still submit the life certificate we send you. This is because the processing life certificates has been automated.

 NAV is not responsible for pensions paid by other countries. If you are submitting a life certificate to another country, you may contact [the any district court or Oslo County Court for help with signatures or attestation (domstol.no).](https://www.domstol.no/andre-arend/notarialbekreftelse/)
