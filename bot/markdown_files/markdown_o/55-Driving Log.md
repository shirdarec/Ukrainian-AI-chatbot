#Driving Log
If NAV has approved the use of a private car for activities related to work or education, you can submit a Driving Log for a refund on your driving expenses.
NAV must approve the use of a private car before you are permitted to submit the Driving Log.

 NAV will approve the use of private vehicles if there is no public transport available for your destination or if public transport is not practical or possible for you.

 You must first apply for and receive approval for supplemental travel benefits before using your car for the permitted activities.

 ### Travel expenses for work or education

 If you are ill or injured, NAV may in some cases cover extra expenses for travel to your place of work or education instead of offering a work assessment allowance. Support is limited to the amount you would have been paid via the work assessment allowance for the same period.  
 You can read more about [applying for travel benefits here (in Norwegian)](https://www.nav.no/fyllut/nav111205).

 ### Travel expenses for assistive technology adaptations

 You may also be eligible for a reimbursement on the cost of adapting assistive technology.   
 [More information on travel expenses related to assistive technology is available here (in Norwegian)](https://www.nav.no/fyllut/nav100717).

 * Use NAV's Driving Log to document your expenses so we can repay what you are entitled to.
* Enter how many days you travelled and the expenses you had for parking in the Driving Log. If your parking expenses exceed NOK 100, these must be documented with receipts.
* Keep in mind that you can only submit Driving Logs for paid costs, not for periods that have not occurred yet. The length of a period depends on whether you have applied for monthly or weekly payments.
* If you wish, you can submit Driving Logs for several periods at a time.
* The amount of support you are entitled to will be stated in the decision letter you received from NAV. You will also be informed of this amount in the Driving Log itself when you log in.
* The rates that apply to travelling in your car are NOK  kroner per kilometer.

 If you have applied for and received approval for support for daily travel costs using your own car, you will receive the payment approximately 2-3 working days after submitting the Driving Log.  
   
 If you had parking expenses amounting to more than 100 kroner a day, the Driving Log must be processed manually which may take a little longer to process.
