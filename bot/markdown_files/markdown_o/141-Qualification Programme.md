#Qualification Programme
A programme for people between the ages of 18 and 67 years who want to start working, but need a little extra follow-up to be able to do so.
The qualification programme (“KVP”) is for people who need some extra support to be able to find work. You can apply to participate in the programme yourself, but NAV will determine whether the programme is suitable for you. It is important that the content of your programme will make it easier for you to find work.

 You must meet a number of requirements to be eligible for the programme. You must

 * be of working age
* have a significantly reduced ability to work and earn income
* need close follow-up
* not be receiving or be receiving only very limited financial support from NAV
* have undergone a [work ability assessment](/arbeidsevne) (text in Norwegian)
* have legal residence in Norway and a permanent place to live in Norway (permanent address)

 Your programme will be individually tailored to you and your particular challenges. What support and assistance do you need to be able to find work? Together, you and your counsellor draw up a programme that includes work-oriented measures, training activities, individual follow-up and guidance.

 The programme may also include other activities that will help prepare you for work, such as motivation training, Norwegian language courses, housing follow-up, and financial advice and planning. You can also have time allocated in the programme for necessary health assistance.

 You will be responsible for following the programme in cooperation with counsellors at the NAV office.

 The qualification programme takes 37.5 hours a week.

 The benefit will be reduced if you

 * are absent without a valid reason
* have income from work or pay as an apprentice
* are entitled to unemployment benefit, sickness benefit or parental benefit

 If you drop out of the programme, you will lose your entitlement to qualification benefit.

 ### Other relevant benefits

 NAV may cover all or some of your expenses in connection with work-oriented assessments or an activity.

  You may be entitled to [financial social assistance](https://www.nav.no/sosialhjelp/en) if your qualification benefit does not cover your necessary housing and living expenses.

 If you have your own home, you may be entitled to [housing support from the Norwegian State Housing Bank](https://husbanken.no/english/housing-allowance/).

 You can receive child maintenance, child benefit and cash-for-care benefit alongside qualification benefit.

 ### Qualification benefit and holidays

 The qualification programme runs for up to 1 year at a time.

 The programme may be extended by 1 year if you and your counsellor decide that it is necessary. In some cases, the programme may be extended by yet another year.

 The date on which the benefit is paid out varies from municipality to municipality. The decision letter you receive from NAV will contain information about payments in your case.

If the date of payment falls on a weekend or public holiday, you will usually receive the money the day before.
