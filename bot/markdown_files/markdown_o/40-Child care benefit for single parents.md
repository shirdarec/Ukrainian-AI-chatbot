#Child care benefit for single parents
Covers part of the cost for kindergarten, after-school program (SFO) or daycare when you have sole care of a child and are working.
Generally, you may be entitled to transitional benefit if

 To qualify for child care benefit, you must be in work or in the process of setting up your own business and leave the looking after of your child(ren) to others.  
   
 If you have an illness that prevents you from working, you can receive child care benefit for up to one year. The illness must not be chronic (permanent).  
   
 If you combine work with education or looking for work, you can get this benefit if you pay for child minding while you are at work.

 If you are currently not in work, but are registered with NAV as a job seeker or taking education that NAV has approved, as a general rule you will not be entitled to this benefit. In this case, you can apply for benefit for child minding.

 This benefit is intended to contribute towards covering your expenses related to having your child in day care. Expenses for food, nappies, etc. are not covered.  
   
 You must provide documentation of your child minding expenses with an invoice made out to you. This invoice must be specified and indicate the expenses related to having a child in day care separately.  
   
 If you have private child minding arrangements, such as a babysitter or child minder, you must submit the agreement you have with the person who looks after your child when you apply. Here is a [template for an [agreement on private child minding arrangements *(PDF 52 kB)*](/_/attachment/inline/4ca6c120-caa2-415d-972b-12bc08aa2d64:d4c1c17869c51f69ae364e1aa8770b297308c53f/Avtale%20privat%20barnepass.pdf) (in Norwegian). This template also indicates what information we need to process your application.  
   
 For example, if you work in the evening, at night, shift work, weekend work, commute or work at sea, you can get support to cover the costs of child minding after kindergarten and child care at school outside school hours (SFO). You must provide documentation of your working hours.

 The same applies if you have a job that entails that you have to be away from home for extended periods of time. In order for an absence to be regarded as longer than usual, it must exceed ten hours per day. You must provide documentation of your working hours.

 This benefit covers 64 per cent of your child minding expenses, such as kindergarten, child care at school outside school hours (SFO), or a babysitter or child minder. In other words, you have to pay at least 36 per cent of the expenses yourself.  
   
 You can have the costs of child minding covered up to a defined upper limit set by the Storting.

 You are not entitled to child care benefit if your monthly income, multiplied by 12, comes to more than NOK , i.e. six times the National Insurance basic amount (“G”).  
   
 We include all your earnings in our calculation. Any benefits you receive from NAV will also be included in the calculation:

 * unemployment benefit
* sickness benefit
* attendance allowance, care benefit, training allowance
* work assessment allowance (AAP)
* parental benefit
* carer support / foster care allowance

 If you receive cash-for-care benefit, the amount of benefit you receive per month will be deducted from your documented monthly expenses for child care. The cash-for-care benefit will be deducted from your child care expenses for both the child(ren) you receive cash-for-care benefit for and other children who live with you.  
   
 This applies even if the cash-for-care benefit is paid to someone else who lives with you and the child.  
   
 Thus, if your cash-for-care benefit is higher than your child minding expenses, you will not be entitled to child care benefit.

 You may be entitled to reduced parental fees for the kindergarten place if your income is below the municipality’s threshold. Some municipalities have similar arrangements for parental fees for child care at school outside school hours (SFO). Contact your municipal authorities for more information about this.  
   
 You must notify us if you are granted reduced parental fees by the municipal authorities, because it may affect your child care benefit. If you receive too much benefit, we can demand that you pay back the excess.

 The main rule is that you can receive child care benefit until your child has completed their fourth year at school. There are no other restrictions on how long you can receive benefit for, as long as you continue to meet the conditions.  
   
 After the fourth year of school, children can usually look after themselves after school while their parents work. This is also the last year children are generally entitled to child care at school outside school hours (SFO).

 In some cases, you may be entitled to receive child care benefit after your child has completed their fourth year of school:

 * If you have children who need significantly more looking after than other children of the same age. You must provide documentation of this need in the form of a statement from a doctor, specialist or other health care professional.
* If you have a job that means you have to be away from home for extended periods of time. In order for an absence to be considered longer than usual, it must exceed ten hours per day. You must provide documentation of your working hours.
* For example, if you work in the evening, at night, shift work, weekend work, commute or work at sea. You must provide documentation of your working hours.

 Child care benefit is normally granted for one year at a time, and you must reapply each year and provide documentation of your expenses each year.  
   
 You will receive benefit up to the end of June each year. July is usually a payment-free month in kindergartens and child care at school outside school hours (SFO). If you nevertheless have child care expenses in July, you must provide documentation of this.

 You can receive transitional benefit for up to three years. Periods during which you receive benefit will be deducted from this period if you receive child care benefit. This applies if:

 You can apply as soon as you have received an invoice from the childcare scheme for the month in which you are applying for benefits. If you apply for child care benefits as of August, you must attach an invoice for August.

 If you have private childcare, for example a daycare, you must document the expenses by attaching the agreement you have with the childcare provider when you apply.

 Benefit will be paid by the 20th of every month. The day on which the benefit is paid may vary from month to month.

 If you are entitled to retroactive child care benefit, you will receive this money shortly after your application has been processed.
