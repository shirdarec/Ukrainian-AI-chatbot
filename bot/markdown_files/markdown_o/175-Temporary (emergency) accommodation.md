#Temporary (emergency) accommodation
NAV can help you find temporary accommodation when you are unable to find a place to stay yourself.
People who do not have anywhere to sleep and stay for the next 24 hours can be offered temporary accommodation.

 Emergency situations include a fire, family problems or relationship break-up, being evicted from the place you were living, etc.

 Relevant temporary accommodation may be a guesthouse or hospice.

 The accommodation provided must be suitable and safe. The requirement regarding suitable and safe accommodation is stricter for families with children and young people.

 If you do not have money to pay for the accommodation yourself, you can [apply for social assistance](https://www.nav.no/sosialhjelp/en).

 Temporary accommodation is intended to help you out in an emergency situation and should not last more than 3 months.

 We can provide advice and guidance to help you find a permanent home. If you are unable to find a place to live yourself, we can help you. For example, we can contact landlords on your behalf or accompany you to viewings.

 Contact your local NAV office if you need temporary accommodation.Â
