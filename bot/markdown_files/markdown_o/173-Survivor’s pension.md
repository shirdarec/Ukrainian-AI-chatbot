#Survivor’s pension
Ensures income if you lose your spouse, partner or cohabitant with whom you have joint children.
You may be entitled to survivor’s pension if:

* you were married to the deceased at the time of their death and the marriage had lasted at least 5 years
* you were married to the deceased at the time of their death and you have or had joint children
* you were separated at the time of death. If you were separated you will still be considered to be legally married
* you were living with the deceased at the time of their death and you have or had joint children
* you had been living with the deceased for more than 5 years at the time of their death and you had previously been married to each other
* you were divorced from the deceased and have not remarried. As a general rule, you will receive survivor’s pension if your divorced spouse dies within 5 years of the divorce and the marriage had lasted at least 25 years, or at least 15 years if you have children together
* you had previously lived together as cohabiting partners for at least 15 years and have or had joint children, and it has been less than 5 years since you moved apart. The number of years you lived together as cohabiting partners is calculated from the date your joint child was born

As a general rule, the deceased must have been a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme for the last 5 years before their death. In some cases, membership of social security schemes in other EEA countries may be treated as equivalent to membership of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme.

A surviving partner has the same rights as a surviving spouse.

### Did the marriage last less than 5 years?

 If the marriage lasted less than 5 years and you do not have joint children, or if you have daily care of the deceased’s children, you may be entitled to transitional benefit for a surviving spouse or partner.

  ### Are you on a pension or disability benefit?

 If you are receiving a pension or have reached the age of 67 years, you can receive a survivor’s supplement to your old-age pension. See the section [What happens when you become a pensioner?](https://www.nav.no/gjenlevendepensjon/en/#pensioner)

 See what rules apply [if you are on disability benefit](https://www.nav.no/gjenlevendepensjon/en/#disability-benefit).

   ### How does earned income from work affect survivor’s pension?

 Your survivor’s pension will be reduced if you have or can be expected to have your own earned income.

 NAV offers various services and support schemes for those who need help finding a job (information in Norwegian):

  If you are undertaking an education that NAV means is necessary for you to get a job and support yourself, you may get additional benefits. The same applies if you are registered as a jobseeker with NAV (information in Norwegian):

   If you have had little or no employment income, you may be entitled to payment until you are 67 years old. It is your income in 2019-2023 that determines whether you are entitled to the payments.

 **Who can keep the payments until age 67 years?**  
 Your employment income must have been below 3 times the average national inurance basic amount (G) in 2022 and 2023:

 

|  |
| --- |
| Average basic amount (G) x 3: |
| 2022 | 329 352 kroner |
| 2023 | 348 717 kroner |

 In addition, your employment income in 2019-2023 must have been below 2 times the basic amount (G) on average:

 

|  |
| --- |
| Average basic amount (G) x 2: |
| 2019 | 197 732 kroner |
| 2020 | 201 706 kroner |
| 2021 | 209 432 kroner |
| 2022 | 219 568 kroner |
| 2023 | 232 478 kroner |

 NAV needs to know your income for 2023 in order to assess whether you can keep financial support until you turn 67. The earliest we can see if you are entitled to financial support is in the autumn of 2024 when the figures from the Tax Agency are ready.

 If you keep the financial support until you turn 67, your pension will be recalculated from 1 January 2029. This may mean that you will receive lower payments from 2029.

 ### When might you lose your survivor’s pension?

 Survivor’s pension will stop if you

 * remarry
* have a child with a cohabiting partner
* start living with someone you have previously been married to
* start living with someone you have or have had children with

 ### What happens when you become a pensioner

 You cannot combine survivor’s pension with [a public-sector contractual early retirement pension (AFP)](/en/home/benefits-and-services/relatert-informasjon/contractual-early-retirement-pension-afp-in-the-public-sector). In some cases, survivor’s pension may be combined with [a private-sector contractual early retirement pension (AFP) that you started drawing after 2011](/en/home/benefits-and-services/relatert-informasjon/contractual-early-retirement-pension-afp-in-the-private-sector-from-2011).

 Survivor’s pension stops when you turn 67 years at the latest, or if you start drawing your old-age pension before the age of 67.

 ### Survivor’s supplement to your old-age pension

 As an old-age pensioner, you may be entitled to a survivor’s supplement to your old-age pension.

 If your own earned pension is higher than the deceased’s, you will not receive a supplement to your old-age pension.

   ### Your year of birth is important when NAV calculates pensions for old-age pensioners with entitlements from a deceased spouse or spousal equivalent

 **For survivors born before 1943, the rules are as follows:**

 * Your basic pension should usually constitute a full basic pension, but will be reduced in line with [the rules in section 3-2.](https://lovdata.no/nav/folketrygdloven/kap3/%C2%A73-2)
* Your supplementary pension will be 55 per cent of your own earned supplementary pension and 55 per cent of the deceased’s earned supplementary pension. You keep your own earned supplementary pension if it is higher than 55 per cent of both parties’ supplementary pensions.
* You will receive a pension supplement if the sum total of your basic pension and supplementary pension is lower than [the minimum pension level at the special higher rate.](https://www.nav.no/satser#alderspensjon)
* If you have a reduced pension because you have a reduced period of national insurance cover, the period of national insurance cover of the party with the highest pension earnings will be used as the basis for your future pension.

 **For survivors born between 1943 and 1954, the rules are as follows:**

 * Your basic pension should usually constitute a full basic pension, but will be reduced in line with [the rules in section 3-2.](https://lovdata.no/nav/folketrygdloven/kap3/%C2%A73-2)
* Your supplementary pension will be 55 per cent of your own earned supplementary pension and 55 per cent of the deceased’s earned supplementary pension. You keep your own earned supplementary pension if it is higher than 55 per cent of both parties’ supplementary pensions.
* A pension supplement is granted if the sum total of your basic pension and supplementary pension is lower than the minimum pension level at the special higher rate.
* If you have a reduced pension because you have a reduced period of national insurance cover, the period of national insurance cover of the party with the highest pension earnings will be used as the basis for your future pension.
* Your total old-age pension including your entitlements from the deceased will be calculated on the basis of the same life expectancy adjustment and regulation as your pension before the deceased died.
* If you are under the age of 67 years, you cannot receive survivor’s pension if you are already receiving old-age pension. The same applies if you are receiving graded old-age pension. However, if you had set your withdrawal percentage on your old-age pension to 0 before the deceased died, you may nevertheless be entitled to survivor’s pension.

 ### Are you receiving survivor’s pension and are considering applying for old-age pension?

 If you are receiving a pension as a surviving spouse, this pension will stop when you turn 67 years of age. However, if you have sufficient pension earnings, you can choose to start drawing your old-age pension before you turn 67. If you do so, you will no longer qualify for survivor’s pension. Your old-age pension will then be calculated with entitlements from the deceased.

 Please note that you cannot return to receiving survivor’s pension once you have chosen to start drawing your old-age pension. 

 When assessing whether you meet the conditions for being able to start drawing your old-age pension before you turn 67, we take only your own earned pension into account. If you meet the conditions, your additional entitlements as a survivor will also be calculated with the same life expectancy adjustment as your own earned old-age pension. 

 ### Are you a surviving spouse and want to apply for survivor’s pension or old-age pension?

 If you are under the age of 67 and are not receiving survivor’s pension, you can choose between old-age pension and survivor’s pension. If you choose old-age pension, you will be able to receive old-age pension that includes entitlements from the deceased.

 Please note that you cannot receive survivor’s pension once you have chosen to start drawing your old-age pension. If you would like more information or help calculating your pension, do not hesitate to contact us on (+47) 55 55 33 34.

 ### What happens to your pension when your spouse, cohabitant or partner dies?

 If you are already receiving old-age pension when your spouse, partner or cohabitant dies, you may be entitled to a higher old-age pension, because you benefit from the deceased’s earned pension. Once the death has been registered with NAV, you will receive a letter informing you about your rights. 

 NAV will follow up your case and assess whether entitlements from your deceased spouse qualify you for a higher pension, even if we do not receive an application from you. We will follow up on your case within 3 months of the deceased’s death. If we do not have enough information, we will contact you and ask you to send it to us. 

 If you are already receiving your own old-age pension, you will have your pension converted into the rates for single pensioners. 

 ### How to apply if you were divorced from the deceased

 If you were divorced from the deceased, you may nevertheless have rights as a survivor in some cases. 

 You must submit a paper application. It is important that you fill in all the relevant fields and submit all the necessary documentation, so that your case can be processed promptly. You will be notified as you fill in the application if you need to provide documentation of any of the information you have provided.

  ### Have you been informed that you need to submit an application?

 If you receive information from NAV that you need to submit an application in order for us to assess your pension entitlements, this is because

 * you live abroad and your deceased spouse, partner or cohabitant did not receive old-age pension, disability benefit or contractual early retirement pension from NAV, or
* you are under the age of 67 and have not started drawing your old-age pension

 You must submit a paper application. It is important that you fill in all the relevant fields and submit all the necessary documentation, so that your case can be processed promptly. You will be notified as you fill in the application if you need to provide documentation of any of the information you have provided.

  Other benefits from NAV will not be affected by the changes in the old-age pension. If you are receiving an occupational pension, you will be notified by your pension scheme if there are going to be any changes in the payments you receive from them. 

 ### For people born in the period 1954–1957 who started drawing their old-age pension with additional entitlements as a survivor before 1 January 2020, the rules are as follows:

 You will receive old-age pension calculated according to a combination of both [the old and the new rules](/no/person/pensjon/alderspensjon/relatert-informasjon/beregning-av-alderspensjon). If you were born in 1954, one tenth of your pension will be calculated according to the new rules and nine tenths will be calculated according to the old rules. If you were born the following year, two tenths of your pension will be calculated according to the new rules, and eight tenths will be calculated according to the old rules; and so on and so forth.

 The additional entitlements as a survivor in the old-age pension under the old rules are different from the survivor’s supplement to the old-age pension under the new rules. Under the old rules, additional entitlements as a survivor in the old-age pension are calculated as follows:

 * Your basic pension should usually constitute a full basic pension, but may be reduced. The length of your period of national insurance cover, your marital status and a number of other factors affect the size of your basic pension.
* Your basic pension will be calculated on the basis of the deceased’s period of national insurance cover if this is longer than your period of national insurance cover.
* Your supplementary pension will be 55 per cent of your own earned supplementary pension and 55 per cent of the deceased’s earned supplementary pension. You keep your own earned supplementary pension if it is higher than 55 per cent of both parties’ supplementary pensions.
* You will receive a pension supplement if the sum total of your basic pension and supplementary pension is lower than [the minimum pension level at the special higher rate.](https://www.nav.no/satser/en#retirement-pension)
* Your total old-age pension including your entitlements from the deceased will be calculated on the basis of the same life expectancy adjustment and regulation as your pension before the deceased died.
* You cannot receive survivor’s pension if you are already receiving old-age pension. The same applies if you are receiving graded old-age pension. However, if you had set your withdrawal percentage on your old-age pension to 0 before the deceased died, you may nevertheless be entitled to survivor’s pension.

 In addition, you will receive survivor’s supplement on that part of your old-age pension that is calculated using the new rules. This supplement is calculated as the difference between the old-age pension with additional entitlements as a survivor in accordance with the old rules for pension earning and your own old-age pension, calculated using the old pension earning rules.

 The difference must be positive in order for you to qualify for survivor’s supplement. The supplement will be adjusted for the proportion of your old-age pension that is calculated according to the new rules for pension earning. For example, people born in 1956 will receive 3/10 of the survivor’s supplement.

 ### For people born in the period 1954–1962 who started drawing their old-age pension with additional entitlements as a survivor after 1 January 2020, the rules are as follows:

 * Your basic pension should usually constitute a full basic pension, but may be reduced. The length of your period of national insurance cover, your marital status and a number of other factors affect the size of your basic pension.
* Your basic pension will be calculated on the basis of the deceased’s period of national insurance cover if this is longer than your period of national insurance cover.
* Your supplementary pension will be 55 per cent of your own earned supplementary pension and 55 per cent of the deceased’s earned supplementary pension. You keep your own earned supplementary pension if it is higher than 55 per cent of both parties’ supplementary pensions.
* A pension supplement is granted if the sum total of your basic pension and supplementary pension is lower than the [minimum pension level at the special higher rate](https://www.nav.no/satser#alderspensjon).
* Your total old-age pension including your entitlements from the deceased will be calculated on the basis of the same life expectancy adjustment and regulation as your pension before the deceased died.
* If you are under the age of 67 years, you cannot receive survivor’s pension if you are already receiving old-age pension. The same applies if you are receiving graded old-age pension. However, if you had set your withdrawal percentage on your old-age pension to 0 before the deceased died, you may nevertheless be entitled to survivor’s pension.

 Only people who can start drawing their old-age pension with additional entitlements as a survivor before 1 January 2020 are entitled to a survivor’s supplement to the old-age pension under the new pension earning rules.

 ### Are you receiving disability benefit

 Survivor’s pension stops if you are entitled to and are granted disability benefit. It is your choice whether you want to carry on receiving survivor’s pension or prefer to receive disability benefit with an additional survivor’s supplement. Read more about [additional survivor’s in the disability benefit and how to apply](/en/home/benefits-and-services/relatert-informasjon/survivor-benefit-when-you-recieve-disability-benefit).

 Note: you have to make this decision **before** you are granted disability benefit. If you wish to continue receiving survivor’s pension, you will have to withdraw your application for disability benefit before it is granted. [Write to us](https://www.nav.no/person/kontakt-oss/nb/skriv-til-oss) if you want to withdraw your application for disability benefit.

 Once NAV has granted disability benefit, this decision is binding, and you can no longer choose to retain your survivor’s pension.

 The Norwegian Parliament has adopted new rules regarding the survivor’s pension from 1 January 2024.

 If you already receive a survivor's pension, the general rule is that you will keep it for 3 years.

 For those who are bereaved after 30 November 2023, the rules for adjustment allowance will apply:

 ### New rules for survivors from 2024

 The current survivor’s pension will be replaced by an adjustment allowance. The allowance is intended to guarantee an income and to help you help yourself in an adjustment period after the death. After 6 months, you will normally be expected to have found employment or be participating in another type of activity, so that you can eventually provide for yourself.

 These changes will likely take effect from 1 January 2024.

 ### What is an adjustment allowance?

 * A time-limited benefit that normally only lasts 3 years.
* The benefit may be extended by up to 2 years, if you need help finding employment, such as completing an education or work training.
* If you were born in 1963 or earlier and you had a low earned income in the last five years before the death, you may keep the benefit until you turn 67 years old.
* The benefit is 2.25 times the National Insurance basic amount G, currently NOK , depending on the period of national insurance coverage for the person who died.
* If your income exceeds 0.5 times G, currently NOK , the benefit will be reduced.
* The benefit is regarded as pensionable income.

  You can apply online or on paper. If you apply online, you do not need to submit documentation.
