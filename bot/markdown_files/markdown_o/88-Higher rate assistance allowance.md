#Higher rate assistance allowance
Financial support for children under the age of 18 when the need for care and supervision significantly exceeds those covered by the standard assistance allowance.
The child may be granted higher rate assistance allowance if

 * the child is under 18 years of age
* child’s needs for care and supervision [significantly exceeds those covered by the standard assistance allowance](/hjelpestonad/en)
* the allowance will increase the likelihood that the child can live at home
* the child is a [member of Norwegian National Insurance](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme)

 The child may qualify for higher rate assistance allowance even if the child does not live at home full-time. The condition is that parents, foster parents or other persons who are close to the child provide the care and supervision the child needs.

 The child may qualify for assistance allowance even if the child is admitted to hospital.

 In considering the need for higher rate assistance allowance, the following is taken into account:

 * the degree of physical and mental functional impairment
* the scope of care and supervision needed
* the need for stimulation, training and physical activity
* the total workload on the person(s) providing the care

 The child cannot be granted higher rate assistance allowance to cover practical assistance, such as cooking, cleaning or shopping.

 Higher rate assistance allowance is granted in accordance with rates 2, 3 or 4. The child’s care needs determine the rate that applies.

 If the child lives at home less than 50 percent of the time, the rates for higher rate attendance benefits may be reduced.

 If the child is granted higher rate assistance allowance at rate 3 or 4, one of the child’s parents is automatically [granted pension points](/no/person/pensjon/pensjonsopptjening-for-omsorgsarbeid).

  The child may receive a higher rate assistance allowance until the end of the month the child turns 18 years old. The child’s need for care and supervision may change over time. NAV will therefore review the allowance every three years. You will receive a letter where we request information.

 If the child dies, parents who have been receiving a higher rate assistance allowance for at least three years, have the right to keep the assistance allowance for a transitional period of 3 months after the death of the child. This does not apply to rate 1 allowances.

    Higher rate assistance allowances are paid monthly.

If your need for a higher rate assistance allowance changes, you must [notify NAV immediately](/endringer/en).
