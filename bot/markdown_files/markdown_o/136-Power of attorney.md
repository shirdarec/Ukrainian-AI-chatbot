#Power of attorney
NAV’s duty of confidentiality covers all your contact with NAV, including any and all information about the services and benefits you receive. For third parties to access any information that NAV might have concerning you, they must either have the statutory authority to order NAV to disclose it, or you must grant them a power of attorney.
You have the right to have an attorney represent you in your case with NAV. You are free to choose whom you want to represent you.

 Your attorney must present a written power of attorney, granting him or her the right to represent you. If you have chosen a lawyer to represent you in your case, he or she does not normally have to present a power of attorney.

 Durable powers of attorney pursuant to Section 78 of the Guardianship Act, are processed in line with other powers of attorney.

 A guardian protects the interests of his or her client and may represent the client in all or specific matters.

For adults, the guardian’s mandate shall be clearly defined in the appointment. The appointment must specifically address the scope of the guardianship, including whether the guardian’s authority is limited by matter or time. Depending on the specifications of the appointment, a guardian may have access to any information NAV has concerning his or her client, and may represent said client in meeting with NAV.

The guardian of a minor is normally the person who has parental responsibility for the minor. Pursuant to Section 47 of the Children Act, a parent who does not have parental responsibility for his or her child may also have the right to receive information about the minor from NAV.

### Right of representation

Right of representation for close family members pursuant to Section 94 of the Guardianship Act does not grant the representative access to NAV’s information concerning the family member or the right to represent the person in contact with NAV.
