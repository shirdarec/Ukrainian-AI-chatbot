#Wage guarantee
Ensures that you are paid wages, holiday pay and other payment for work you are due, when your employer is unable to pay.
You may qualify for coverage under the wage guarantee scheme if your employer is bankrupt.

 The condition is that you must have had an employment relationship where your employer was subject to pay employer's contributions to National Insurance.

 Your employer must pay employer's contributions on wages or other remuneration for work performed in Norway, regardless of your or your employer’s connection to this country.

 If you have worked in another EEA country, and Norway is the only country where bankruptcy proceedings can be initiated against your employer, your claim may be covered by the Norwegian wage guarantee scheme. This applies even if your employer was not subject to pay employer's contributions to Norwegian authorities.

 The condition is that you do not qualify for wage guarantee coverage in the country where you worked or have national insurance coverage.

 You may also qualify for wage guarantee coverage if

 * the company where you work was put into compulsory liquidation, or
* you worked in an insurance company or a bank, which was put under public administration, or
* the company where you worked is now an insolvent deceased’s estate under public administration (the estate cannot pay).

 #### Who is not eligible?

 The wage guarantee scheme does not cover

 * self-employed persons and independent contractors
* shareholders who have an ownership interest of 20 percent or more in the enterprise, unless you can document that you

 To find out how to go about settling your claim, you must first find out why your employer is not paying.

 If your employer does not pay your wages at the agreed time, the reason may be that your employer does not want to pay. If so, you may have to enforce your claim.

 If your employer cannot pay, bankruptcy proceedings may be instituted against your employer.

 You need to contact your employer to find out whether the reason for your employer not paying your wages at the agreed time is caused by your employer being unwilling or unable to pay.

 Regardless of the reason your employer gives you, you cannot wait too long before taking the matter further. There are rules for how old your claim can be in order for you to be covered by the wage guarantee scheme. If you wait too long, you risk losing your coverage under the wage guarantee scheme.
