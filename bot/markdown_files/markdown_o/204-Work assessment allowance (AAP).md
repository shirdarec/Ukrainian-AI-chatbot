#Work assessment allowance (AAP)
Ensures that you have an income during periods where, due to illness or injury, you need help from NAV.
AAP ensures that you have an income during periods where, due to illness or injury, you need help from NAV.

 The goal is that you can pinpoint your options to retain or find work together with NAV. You contribute to reaching that goal through trying out various treatments, participating in employment schemes or acquiring new skills.

 You may be entitled to AAP if all the following apply to you:

 * Your ability to work has been impaired due to illness or injury. As a rule, your ability to work must be impaired by at least 50 per cent.
* Your ability to work must be impaired for all types of work for which you are qualified.
* You need treatment to improve your ability to work or help from NAV to retain or find work.
* As a rule, you must have been a member of the National Insurance Scheme for at least 5 years.
* You are between 18 and 67 years of age.

 ### Your ability to work must be impaired

 To get AAP you must normally have lost at least 50 per cent of your ability to work. The main reason must be illness or injury. Your ability to work must be reduced for all types of work you are qualified for. 

 If  NAV has approved an occupational injury or illness, and NAV has assessed that it is fully or partly the cause of your impaired ability to work, you may receive AAP if your ability to work has been impaired by at least 30 per cent.

 By occupational injury, we mean that you have suffered an injury due to an accident at work. We can approve an illness as an occupational illness if it is caused by harmful factors in the working environment.

 If

 * NAV has approved an occupational injury or illness

 and

 * NAV has assessed that it is fully or partly the cause of your impaired ability to work

 the following applies:

 * You may receive AAP if your ability to work has been impaired by at least 30 per cent.

  #### It must be possible for your ability to work to improve

 In order to receive AAP, it must be possible that your ability to work can improve so that you can retain or find work, through treatment, employment scheme og follow-up.

 ### Treatment

 For example, this may be psychological treatment, physiotherapy, or follow-up by your GP.

 ### Employment scheme

 For example, this may be facilitation, training, work training or a job club. [Read more about employment schemes (text in Norwegian).](https://www.nav.no/komme-i-jobb#tiltak)

 ### Follow-up by NAV

 For example, this may be advice and guidance from NAV Technical Aids Centre or NAV Work Advice, dialogue with your NAV advisor regarding facilitation options and the possibility of continuing in your job. 

 As a rule, you must have been a [member of the National Insurance Scheme](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme) for at least 5 consecutive years before you apply for AAP. 

 If you are between 62 and 67 years of age when you apply, the general rule is that you must have had a pensionable income at least equivalent to the National Insurance [basic amount (G](/grunnbelopet)) (text in Norwegian) the year before your ability to work was impaired. NAV can make exceptions.

 If you meet the criteria both for receiving sickness benefits and AAP, you must first make full use your entitlement to sickness benefits. If your basis for sickness benefits is less than twice the National Insurance basic amount (2G) (NOK  ), you can still choose between sickness benefits and AAP.

 You are entitled to sickness benefits for 52 weeks. If you are approaching the end of your 52-week sickness benefit period and you are still ill, you must apply for AAP yourself. You will not receive AAP automatically. The earliest you can receive AAP is from and including the day you submit your application.

 If you went on sick leave with your first day of absence before 1 June 2021: 

 * If you meet the criteria both for receiving sickness benefits and AAP, you are entitled to choose the higher benefit of the two.

 If you went on sick leave with your first day of absence after 1 June 2021:

 * If you meet the criteria both for receiving sickness benefits and AAP, you must first make full use your entitlement to sickness benefits. If your basis for sickness benefits is less than twice the National Insurance basic amount (2G), you can still choose between sickness benefits and AAP.

 If you receive sick pay for a part-time job (up to 60 percent of full-time), you can be entitled to both sick pay and reduced Work Assessment Allowance (AAP).

 If you are student in higher education, or a pupil in upper secondary school, and you have to put your education on hold for up to 6 months due to illness or injury, you may qualify for AAP even if your capacity for any work has not been reduced.

 This applies if

 * you have put your education completely on hold
* you need medical treatment before you will be able to resume your education
* your programme of study or upper secondary education is approved for support from the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (Lånekassen)

 If you are receiving a loan/grant from Lånekassen, you will not be entitled to AAP for the period when you are entitled to an illness grant.

 You must apply for AAP for us to consider your case. Along with your application, you must submit

 * documentation from your school/educational institution confirming that you have put your education on hold
* documentation of your right to student loans and, if relevant, a sickness grant from Lånekassen

 AAP is determined based on the pensionable income you earned the year before your ability to work was impaired by at least 50 per cent.

 You can receive 66 per cent of your income up to6G, which is equivalent to NOK . 

 You can read more about how we [calculate your AAP](/aap/en#calculate) below.

 #### What will you be paid?

 How much you will receive depends on

 * your daily rate
* whether you are supporting children
* how much you are working
* what you report on your employment status form
* whether you are entitled to both sick pay and reduced AAP
* whether you submit your employment status form before the deadline
* whether you comply with your duty to act
* your tax deduction

 AAP is taxed as income and is pensionable income. Read more about [tax deduction and benefits from NAV (text in Norwegian)](/skattetrekk).

 There are two ways to find your calculation basis. We will always choose the method that gives you the highest calculation basis.

 We divide your calculation basis by 260 (the number of working days in the year). This is your daily rate.

 Several factors can be important:

 #### Ordinary period with AAP

 As a rule, you can receive AAP for up to 3 years. 

 However, the length of time in which you receive AAP will depend on how long you need to participate in work-oriented activities or receive medical treatment before you can work. The AAP period will therefore vary individually. 

 There are separate rules for an extension beyond the ordinary period. During the Covid-19 pandemic, some recipients have been granted an extension of their ordinary AAP period. 

 #### Extension

 As you approach the end of your AAP period, we will assess whether you are entitled to an extension. You do not need to apply for an extension. We will discuss relevant work-oriented activities with you.

 You may be entitled to an extension if you are already working and are close to being able to increase your ability to work or to finding or returning to work. You need to have an ability to work of more than 50 per cent.

 You may also receive an extension to complete a training scheme you have started. 

 Your AAP period can be extended by a maximum of 2 years. We cannot grant your application for APP while you are entitled to an extension of your AAP period.

 #### New period

 If you are not entitled to an extension beyond 3 years, you can apply for a new AAP period. You may also be entitled to a new period following an extension of your AAP period.

 If you are not entitled to an extension beyond 3 years, you can apply for a new AAP period. You may also be entitled to a new period following an extension of your AAP period.

 A new AAP period may be granted if

 * your ability to work is still impaired by at least 50 per cent due to illness or injury and
* you need treatment, work-oriented activities or other follow-up by us in order to return to work

 You must submit an application for AAP. 

 By logging in to nav.no, you can see whether we have received your application. 

 #### We recommend that you register your CV

 In order to process your application, we need to know your education and work experience. Therefore, you should [register and update your CV at arbeidsplassen.no](https://arbeidsplassen.nav.no/) at the same time as you are applying for AAP.

 This also applies if you are returning to work for your employer. 

 If information and documentation are missing, we will ask you to submit this as soon as possible. We can ask you, your GP or others to submit information if this is necessary. If we have requested necessary documentation, but have not received this, your application may be dismissed.

 Your application will not be dismissed until you have been notified that information or documentation is missing.

 When you apply for AAP while starting your own bussiness, you must also fill in the form Evaluation of start-up plans:

 You may receive several letters and inquiries from NAV along the way. You will always be given:

 * A work ability assessment
* a follow-up decision
* a decision where we grant or refuse AAP

 ### Work ability assessment

 If you have challenges affecting your job opportunities, your NAV advisor will assess your job opportunities with you. We call this a work ability assessment. We assess your ability to work based on conversations with you, the information you have provided and the information in your CV. Read more about how we conduct a [work ability assessment](/arbeidsevne) (text in Norwegian):

  We use your work ability assessment as a basis for the follow-up decision and our decision regarding AAP.

 If you have comments on the work ability assessment we have made, you can give us feedback, e.g. through the [dialogue service in the activity plan](/aktivitetsplan/en).

  ### A follow-up decision

 A follow-up decision is an assessment by us regarding the help you need to find or return to work. This decision is not about financial support.

 The follow-up decision informs you of  

 * your job opportunities and obstacles preventing you from finding gainful employment
* your need for work-oriented activities
* the objective of these activities
* our contribution

 The follow-up decision contains one of the following conclusions:  

 * That you can find work without our help
* That you can find work with some help from us
* That you can find work with a lot of our help
* That your opportunities for finding gainful employment are limited

 ### Decision on work assessment allowance (AAP)

 If you have applied for APP and we find that your ability to work has been impaired by at least 50 per cent due to illness or injury, and the other criteria have been met, you will receive a decision that you have been granted AAP.

  

 #### The duty to act

 In order to receive AAP, you need to help clarify whether you can start or return to work. This is called the duty to act.

 The activity plan involves

 * you helping to create a specific activity planfor what you are going to do to find or return to work.
* you attend agreed meetings with NAV.
* you provide the necessary information and documentation we need to help you.
* You complete the activities you and NAV have agreed on in your activity plan.

 You must [notify NAV](/kontaktoss/en) if anything prevents you from following the agreed activity plan.

 #### Activity plan and dialogue with your NAV advisor

 You will find your activity plan at nav.no which you and your NAV advisor have created together. You use your activity plan to have a dialogue with your NAV advisor, notify of changes in your situation and add activities that can improve your ability to work.

 You can also find minutes from meetings you have had with us here. Read more about the activity plan and dialogue with your NAV advisor (text in Norwegian). 

  Following dialogue with us, your activity plan can be adjusted to suit your situation. If your NAV advisor proposes activities for you, then you answer by sending a message in the dialogue service, 

 You cannot appeal if you want a special work-oriented activity but have not received an offer of this from us.

 * [Go to activity plan](https://aktivitetsplan.nav.no/)
* [Go to the dialogue service with your advisor](https://nav.no/arbeid/dialog)

 If you do not comply with the agreed duty to act, and there are no reasonable grounds for doing so, we can suspend or reduce your AAP payments. 

 Deductions may be made in your AAP, for example, if you:

 * do not attend a meeting we have called you to.
* do not attend on a specifically agreed day to participate in work-oriented activities, assessments or treatment.
* do not submit within the deadline documentation and/or information we have requested.

 If you have any questions regarding payments and financial support from NAV, you cannot use the dialogue service in the activity plan for this. 

 You may appeal decisions regarding deduction in or suspension of your AAP due to a breach of the duty to act.

 You must keep NAV informed about your situation.

#### Inform NAV when there are changes in your situation

 Changes in your situation may affect the follow-up you receive or the amount you are paid.

 It is **not**sufficient to give notice of such changes on your employment status form — you must contact us as soon as you can. You must also contact us in the event of any other changes that may affect your payments from NAV.

 Check whether you must [inform about holidays, travel or moving](/aap/en#absence).

 #### Inform about interruptions in work-oriented activities

 You must be attending work-oriented activities or receiving follow-up from us to be entitled to AAP. If you interrupt the activity, or you cannot participate in a work-oriented activities, you may lose your right to AAP. For example, such a situation may be compulsory military service or maternity and birth.

 #### Notify NAV if you think you have received too much or too little money

 You must notify if you have received money to which you are not entitled. If you are paid an incorrect amount because you have provided incomplete or incorrect information, we will be able to claim repayment of this money. Repayment can take place in the form of deductions in National Insurance benefits or salary. In some cases, it may also result in criminal liability.

 We can also claim repayment of benefits that were paid due to errors on our part if you understood or should have understood that the payment was incorrect. 

 #### You have to submit an employment status form

 You must keep NAV informed about how you carry out your work-oriented activities.

 If you are granted AAP, you will need to submit an employment status formevery 14 days. You use your employment status form to notify us how you are carrying out work-oriented or other agreed activities. Here you report how many hours you are working and whether you have been absent from your activity.

 We calculate your AAP payments based on the information you provide on the employment status form. If you do not submit an employment status form, you will not receive AAP. Read more about [filling out an employment status form](/no/person/arbeid/slik-gjor-du-det-sider/fyll-ut-meldekort--arbeidsavklaringspenger-aap).
