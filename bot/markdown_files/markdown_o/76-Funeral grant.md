The mother must be a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme, or be living in Norway and be married, or be supported by a parent who is a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme.

 ### The deceased was over the age of 18 years

 If the deceased was over the age of 18, wealth, marital status and income will be considered when calculating the amount of the funeral grant:

 * Wealth as stated in the most recent tax return: If the tax return for the year before death has been prepared, it will be used in the calculation. If the tax return has not been prepared, we will use the tax return two years prior to the death.
* Marital status:
	+ If the deceased was single, we use net worth for the calculation.
	+ If the deceased was married or cohabiting with joint children, we use the couple's gross financial wealth in the calculation. Gross financial wealth includes e.g. cash, bank deposits, tradable shares, bonds, units in securities funds, other transferable securities and outstanding receivables such as loans.
* Death benefits paid by insurance company: These are payments to the estate of the deceased or to minor children. As long as it is the death that entitles the insurance payout, the sum is used in the calculation.
* Occupational pension/pension from parties other than the National Insurance Scheme paid to the deceased for the months following the death is taken into account.
* Payments from funeral funds, organizations, associations or similar that are paid due to death are taken into account.
