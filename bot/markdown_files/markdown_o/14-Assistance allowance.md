#Assistance allowance
Financial support for children or adults who need long-term, private care and supervision.
You or your child may qualify for assistance allowance

 * if your or your child needs care and supervision for medical reasons. You or your child must need assistance with personal needs other people do not need assistance with.
* if the need for assistance lasts 2–3 years or more and is caused by your/your child’s medical condition.
* if the care or supervision is provided by private individuals, such as a spouse, child, parent, foster parent, relative, neighbour or others.
* if you/your child is [a member of Norwegian National Insurance](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme)

 The child may qualify for assistance allowance even if the child is admitted to hospital.

 You or your child may be granted an assistance allowance to cover expenses/acquire private assistance for personal needs.

 Examples include care and supervision needs when you or your child

 * needs care and supervision
* needs assistance with personal grooming and hygiene
* needs assistance with eating

 Care needs may also include stimulation, training and physical activity.

 If your child’s needs for care and supervision significantly exceeds those covered by the standard assistance allowance, your child may be eligible for a higher rate assistance allowance.

  
 You or your child will not be granted an assistance allowance to cover

 * practical assistance, such as cooking, cleaning or shopping
* assistance when other public service provide the assistance, such as home care services. This applies even if you have to pay a fee to the municipality for the service.
* treatment from professional providers of personal services, such as therapists, etc.

 In order to qualify for assistance allowance, care and supervision expenses must, at minimum, be equivalent to rate 1, which is NOK   per month. The amount is intended to cover 2–2.5 hours of private assistance per week.

 Assistance allowance rate 1 is the highest amount paid to persons over 18 years old.

 When a family member needs care and/or supervision, other family members are expected to provide some unpaid assistance. NAV takes this into consideration when we consider the right to assistance allowance.

 There is no limit to how long you can receive an assistance allowance, but your care and supervision needs may change.

 Your need for the allowance may change, which means that you may receive notice from NAV that we are reviewing the allowance.

 Normally, the care arrangement must be in place before you apply. If your financial situation is strained, NAV may accept that the care arrangement starts at the same time as the first assistance allowance payment.

  You will be notified if you need to submit documentation for any of your information.

 Assistance allowances are paid monthly.

    An annual statement will be sent to the child.

 If your need for an assistance allowance changes, you must [notify NAV immediately](/endringer/en).

  If the child is admitted to hospital, the child will keep the assistance allowance.
