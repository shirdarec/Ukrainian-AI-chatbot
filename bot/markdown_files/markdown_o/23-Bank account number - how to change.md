#Bank account number - how to change
You can check your registered account number by logging into nav.no.
You may only have one account number registered with NAV. This applies to all private individuals who receive benefits, pension or refunds from NAV. 

 The account number is also used for payments that NAV makes on behalf of, among others, the State Pension Fund.

 ### Payment to a foreign bank account

 As a general rule, NAV pays to a Norwegian bank account. If you do not have a bank account in Norway, you should state your foreign bank account number, if you have one.

 To receive certain benefits, however, you must be resident in Norway. If you state a foreign bank account number, you must be aware that there is a charge for each payment and that it may take longer for the money to come into your account.

 ### Do you have payments from your local authority or from the Housing Bank?

 About changing account numbers for payments from your local authority or from the Housing Bank: 

 You can not change the account number using nav.no when it comes to payments from the local authority, such as social assistance and qualification benefit. Then you need to contact your local NAV office to change your account number.

You can not change the account number using nav.no when it comes to payments from the Housing Bank, such as “housing allowances”. Then [you must log on to husbanken.no](https://husbanken.no/bostotte/endre-kontonummer-bostotte/).

You can also contact the housing benefit office in your municipality if you want to change the account number.

You can notify changes and send these by post. You must then attach a copy of valid identification, such as your passport or driver’s licence or provide valid proof of your identity when attending a NAV office in person. To change your bank account number, you must also provide your national identity number or D number.

 To notify a change from one Norwegian bank account to another, use the Notification of new bank account number form.

  ### Payments to a foreign bank account

 If you want your payments to be made to a foreign bank account, and you want to send the form by post, you must fill out a separate bank details form.

  Send the completed form to the address provided on the first page of the form. Remember to sign the form and attach a copy of valid identification.

 ### What is valid identification

 Valid identification is an ID card that contains the date of birth, name, signature and photo (eg passport, driver's license, ID card).
