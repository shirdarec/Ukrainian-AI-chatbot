#Supplementary benefit for persons over 67 who have only lived a short period in Norway
Ensures you a higher pension when you have lived in Norway for a short time.
* You must be 67 years or older.
* You must have a residence permit and live in Norway.
* You must have received a decision from NAV regarding retirement pension.

 All income and assets from Norway and abroad are included in calculations when NAV determines whether you are eligible for supplementary benefit. The income and assets of your spouse, co-habiting partner or registered partner will also be taken into account when we decide if you can get the benefit.

 The total income of you and your spouse, co-habiting partner or registered partner must be less than the Pension Guarantee. Pension Guarantee is a guaranteed minimum retirement benefit. 

 The total assets of you and your spouse, co-habiting partner or registered partner must be less than NOK  (this corresponds to half of the National Insurance basic amount) for you to get the benefit. 

 If you stay out of Norway for more than 90 days during your benefit period, the payments of supplementary benefit will stop. 

 #### Did you move to Norway due to family reunification?

 You will not be eligible for supplementary benefit if 

 * you came to Norway due to family reunification with children, grandchildren, a nephew or niece, and
* you received a residence permit because another person guaranteed they would provide for you.

 The amount is dependent on your living situation.
