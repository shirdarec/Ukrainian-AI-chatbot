#Transitional benefit for single parents
Ensures you income for up to 3 years when you have at least 60 per cent of the daily care for children under 8 years of age.
Generally, you may be entitled to transitional benefit if

 #### If you have children between the ages of 1 and 8 years

 Then you must also either work or study at least 50 per cent, be registered as a job seeker with NAV, or be in the process of establishing your own business. In some cases, you may qualify for transitional benefit even if you cannot [work, study, or seek jobs](/overgangsstonad-enslig/en#who).

 If you have, without a reasonable cause, stopped working in the last 6 months before you apply for the benefit, you are not entitled to transitional benefit. You can receive benefits after these 6 months.

 To qualify for transitional benefit, your youngest child must be under the age of 8 years. In some cases, you can receive benefit after your youngest child has turned 8.

 If you have children aged between 1 and 8 years old, you must be in at least 50 per cent occupational activity to qualify for transitional benefit. The purpose of this benefit is to enable you to support yourself and your child(ren).  
   
 You can meet the duty to be in work-related activity in one of the following ways:

 * be in at least 50 per cent work
* be registered with NAV as a job seeker
* be in at least 50 per cent education that NAV has assessed as necessary for you to be able to get a job and support yourself
* set up your own business

 If you combine work with education, you must either work or study at least 50 per cent.  
   
 You can nevertheless receive benefit if you are unable to work, study or seek work due to your own illness, or if you have a sick child, do not have child minding, or have a child who needs extra supervision.

 ### Calculate monthly transitional benefit

 You can receive transitional benefit for up to three years, i.e. 36 months. This does not need to be a continuous period, but can be divided up into multiple periods until the child is 8 years old.  
   
 Periods during which you receive benefit will be deducted from your benefit period even if you do not receive full transitional benefit, for example because you have earned income.

 Periods during which you receive childcare benefit, support for school fees or supplemental benefit will also be deducted from the three-year benefit period, even if you are not granted transitional benefit. This applies if

 In some cases, you may be granted transitional benefit beyond the main benefit period of three years

 Your benefit period can be extended if

 * you are in education that is necessary and appropriate, you can have your benefit extended for up to two years. If you have the sole care of three or more children or you became a sole caregiver of children before you turned 18, you can receive extended benefit for up to three years. This applies until your child turns 8.
* you cannot work because your child needs extra supervision due to physical, mental or major social problems. This applies until your child turns 18.
* you have a new child with a new parent. You can receive a new benefit period until the child is 14 months old.

 If you are already receiving transitional benefit, it can be extended

 * until the end of the school year or apprenticeship you have started, up to a maximum of nine months
* for up to two years if you or your child has a disorder that is not chronic and that prevents you from working – maximum until your child turns 10. In this context, “disorder that is not chronic” means a health disorder that has not lasted more than two years or is not expected to last more than two years
* for up to six months if you have accepted an offer of work, education or child minding and are waiting to start
* for up to six months if you are registered as a job seeker. If you have been a job seeker during the last six months of the main period, the number of months may be reduced

  #### More about

  Transitional benefit is paid from the month after you qualify for benefit.  
   
 You can receive benefit for up to three months before you apply if you were entitled to benefit in this period.  
   
 If you apply before your child is 3 months old, you can receive back payment of benefit for up to five months. That is, you can also receive transitional benefit for the calendar month in which the child was born and for the month before you gave birth.  
   
 Benefit will be paid by the 20th of every month. The day on which the benefit is paid may vary from month to month.

 If you are entitled to retroactive transitional benefit, you will receive this back payment shortly after your application has been processed.

 If you are moving or have moved, we must assess whether you are still entitled to this benefit.

 You must send us information about:

 * whether you still live alone, or are sharing your home with another adult. If you live in a marriage-like relationship, we will need your partner’s name and date of birth
* whether your children are registered in the National Registry as living at your address after you have moved
* any changes to your child access agreement
* whether you will continue to work, study or look for work after you have moved. If any of these have changed, you must provide documentation of your new activity
* whether you meet the conditions for exemption from the duty to be in work-related activity. Illness or other exemption criteria must be documented

 If you have moved or are going to move and need a place in a kindergarten, you must apply for a place in a kindergarten in the new municipality in plenty of time. If you have not applied for a place in a kindergarten in your new municipality in time, you will not be granted exemption from the duty to be in work-related activity.  
   
 If you are receiving childcare benefit and want to continue to receive this benefit after you have moved, you must provide documentation of the expenses in your new municipality. The expenses must be documented by an invoice.  
   
 If you move because you have got a job after having been registered as a job seeker, you may be entitled to financial support for the move. Read more about supplemental benefit.
