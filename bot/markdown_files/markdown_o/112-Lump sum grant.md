#Lump sum grant
A lump sum instead of parental benefit when you are expecting a child and have not had income for at least 6 of the last 10 months before parental benefit leave.
You can receive the lump sum grant if you have not had an income which entitles you to the parental benefit. You can also choose to apply for the lump sum grant even if you are entitled to parental benefit. 

 There are normally two requirements you must meet to receive the lump sum grant.

 * You are the mother of the child. In some instances, the [father or co-mother can receive the lump sum grant.](/engangsstonad/en#father_co-mother)
* You live in Norway

 Lump sum grant are intended to help cover some of the expenses in connection with having children.

 #### Birth and adoption

 You may receive lump sum grant upon birth or adoption of the child.

 If you lose a child during pregnancy or at birth, you can in some situations receive the lump sum grant, if you apply for it.

 All living-born children, before and after the 22nd week of pregnancy, are granted a lump sum grant, even if the child dies shortly or immediately after birth.

 If the child is stillborn in the 22nd week of pregnancy or later you may receive a lump sum grant. If the child is stillborn before the 22nd week of pregnancy, you are not entitled to a lump sum grant.

 You will receive a lump sum grant for each of the children in the case of twins or multiple children.

 As a mother, have you applied for parental benefit, but your case has not yet been processed? You can then withdraw your application and instead apply for a lump sum grant. If your application for parental benefits has been processed and you have received a decision, you cannot change to a lump sum grant, even if your child dies. 

 You can withdraw your application for parental benefit by writing to us. 

   #### Membership

 To be entitled to a lump sum grant, you must be a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme at the time of birth or adoption.

 If you live in Norway, you are usually a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. See [more about membership here.](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme)

 If we must decide whether you have membership in the national insurance scheme, it may take longer to process your application. In some cases where there is great uncertainty about the membership, we cannot process your application until after the child is born, or after care for the child has been taken over.

 If you are staying in an EEA country, you may receive a lump sum grant if you are a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme during your stay abroad.

 First, you must check whether you keep your membership of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme.

 You are entitled to be paid a lump sum grant if you have children during your stay abroad and you are a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme at the time you give birth or adopt the child.

 If you are staying in a country with which Norway have a social security agreement, it is the provisions in the individual agreement that determine whether you will receive a lump sum grant during your stay abroad.

 First, you must check whether you keep your membership of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme.

 The decisive factor for payment of the lump sum grant during your stay abroad is whether you are covered by the agreement. In addition, lump sum grant must be covered by the agreement.

 #### Situations that do not entitle you to a lump sum grant

 If you adopt the child of your spouse, you are not entitled to a lump sum grant. The same applies if you adopt a child over the age of 15.

 You receive a lump sum grant of NOK  for every child you give birth to or adopt.

 You cannot receive both a lump sum grant and parental benefit for the same child.

 You can choose to apply for a lump sum grant even if you are entitled to parental benefit. Please note that once you have received the decision about lump sum grant, you cannot change yout decision later.

 You may be entitled to parental benefit instead of a lump sum grant if you for at least 6 of the last 10 months before parental leave starts have had income, been in the military or had some of these benefits from NAV:

 * work assessment allowance
* unemployment benefit
* sickness benefit
* nursing or care benefits
* pregnancy benefit
* parental benefit

 When you receive parental benefit:

 * the father or co-mother may be entitled to paternal/co-mother quotas.
* tax will be deducted from the payments.
* the parental benefit will earn you right to other benefits, such as sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and work assessment allowance.

 When you receive lump sum grant:

 * the father og co-mother may be entitled to parental benefit, but the father og co-mother is not entitled to the paternal/co-mother quota. When the father or co-mother applies for parental benefit that is not the quota, there are requirements for your activity. You can read more about it under the section ["Når bare far eller medmor har rett"](https://www.nav.no/foreldrepenger#hvor-lenge).
* tax will not be deducted from the payment.
* the lump sum grant does not earn you right to other benefits.

 If you are the child's father or co-mother, you may in some cases be entitled to the lump sum grant. This may apply:

 * for every child you adopt alone
* if you take over or have parental responsibility for the child when the other parent passes away. You must have had less contact with the child than what is called regular contact ([Children's Act § 43](https://lovdata.no/lov/1981-04-08-7)).
* if you take over the care of the child when the mother passes away in connection with the birth or the takeover of care. A lump sum grant cannot already have been paid to the mother.
* if you have taken over the care of the child within 56 weeks after the child was born or adopted, with a view to take over parental responsibility alone.

 You must be a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme when you take over the care of the child.

 If you adopt the child of your spouse, you are not entitled to a lump sum grant. The same applies if you adopt a child over the age of 15.

 If one of the parents passes away and another caregiver takes over the care of the child, a lump sum grant can be granted.

 The person who takes over the care must have or be assigned parental responsibility for the child.

 The new caregiver must previously have had less contact with the child than what is known as regular contact ([Children's Act § 43](https://lovdata.no/lov/1981-04-08-7)). What matters is the actual extent of the contact, not what has been agreed.
