#Update your contact information
NAV sends post to your address in the Contact and Reservation Register or the Population Register.
When we send letters or information digitally, we use the contact information you have registered in the common Contact and Reservation Register.

If you need to update your contact information, you can do so at [norge.no/en/update-your-contact-information](https://www.norge.no/en/digital-citizen/update-your-contact-information)

Most people who live in Norway are listed with only one address in the National Registry, but you can register up to three addresses:

 * the address where you live **(residential address)**
* the address you want your post sent to (**postal address**). This address may be in another country.
* the address where you are currently staying (**current address**). This option is often used by people who commute on a weekly basis.

 NAV receives all these addresses from the National Registry. You can see your registered address(es) on the Norwegian Tax Administration’s website: skatteetaten.no.
