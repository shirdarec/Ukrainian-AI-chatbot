#Allowance for transportation of the deceased
Covers expenses when the deceased’s body has to be transported over a certain distance.
The person who is covering the expenses of the funeral can apply for support for the transportation of the deceased.

 Cover is limited to necessary transportation expenses to the nearest natural cemetery in relation to the place where the deceased was resident at the time of their death. Alternatively, transportation to and from the nearest crematorium.

 The deceased is considered to be resident at the place where they had their registered address according to the National Registry, unless their last registered address was due to a stay in an institution. The same applies if the deceased was living with a relative due to their need for care.

 In order to receive allowance for transportation of the deceased

 * the deceased must have been a [member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme)at the time of their death
* the death must have occurred in Norway
* the transportation must be within Norway’s borders
* the transportation distance from the place of death to the cemetery must be more than 20 kilometres

 NAV may make an exception from the 20 km limit if 

 * the distance to the nearest funeral directors is very great or
* it is necessary to take a ferry and there is a long waiting time or
* it is necessary to rent a ferry or
* the death occurs during a temporary stay in another Nordic country

 Special rules apply [if the death was due to an occupational injury](https://www.nav.no/yrkesskade#baretransport). There are also special rules if the death occurs outside Norway.

 EEA nationals who die during a temporary stay in Norway may also be entitled to transportation of the deceased in Norway.

 
 Support is limited to expenses for the most affordable natural mode of transport (train, aeroplane, hearse, etc.) and the most affordable natural route.

 You may also be entitled to support for actual, necessary expenses in connection with the funeral. 

  If the requirements for reimbursement of expenses related to transportation of a deceased person are met, you will be reimbursed for your documented expenses minus a user fee. The user fee is NOK .

 Transportation of a deceased person from Norway to another country is not covered by this allowance.  If a person dies abroad, transportation of the deceased to Norway is only reimbursed in a few cases.

 The person who covers the expenses of transportation of the deceased is entitled to this allowance and can apply for it. 

 If you apply for reimbursement of expenses related to transportation of the deceased, you must attach an itemised invoice or other documentation from a funeral director’s specifying

 * the exact route followed by the hearse (exact address of the deceased’s home, the hospital or nursing home, churches, cemetery, chapel of rest and funeral directors)
* the distance in kilometres that the deceased has been transported
* an invoice or customer ID number (“KID number”)

 If there are special conditions linked to transportation, you must provide an explanation.
