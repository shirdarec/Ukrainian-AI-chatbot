#Employment scheme benefits
Benefits you are entitled too while participating in one of NAV's employment schemes.
You may be entitled to employment scheme benefits if you are participating in a labour market scheme and you are over 18 years old.

You are not entitled to employment scheme benefits if you are participating in the qualification programme, are receiving any other monetary support from NAV or receive a salary as an employee in the employment scheme. Working alongside the scheme, for example on weekends or public holidays, does not affect your employment scheme benefits.

In addition to employment scheme benefits, you may qualify for a child supplement and support to cover daily travel expenses.

### Child supplement

If you are the provider for a child under the age of 16, you may qualify for a child supplement. If the child is not registered in the National Population Register, you must document your responsibility as a provider with a birth certificate or certificate of residence for the child. This also applies to newborn infants. You can request a certificate of residence from the Tax Administration.

### Travel expenses

You can request that NAV cover your daily travel expenses to participate in the scheme, as well as travel in connection with workshops, etc. You must apply for travel expense coverage separately, see information about supplemental benefits:

The rate for employment scheme benefits is NOK  per day. The child supplement is NOK  per day.

You will receive employment scheme benefits for the days you participate in your scheme.

You will also receive employment scheme benefits for holidays in connection with Christmas, New Year’s, Easter, Whitsun, 1 May, 17 May and Ascension Day, whenever these days fall on days that you would ordinarily receive employment scheme benefits for.

You can submit a digital application for employment scheme benefits.

 You can also submit a paper-based application. Paper-based application may take longer to process.

 If you are applying for a child supplement, and your child is not registered in the Population Register, you must include a birth certificate or a certificate of residence for any child under the age of 16. Most children will be registered in the Population Register.

If you are applying for supplemental benefits, such as support for school tuition and fees, examination fees, etc., you must document your expenses.

You will receive a written decision when the application has been processed.

You will lose your enrolment in the scheme if you

 * fail to attend the first day and do not notify anyone of your absence
* start your participation in a scheme, but you are absent so often NAV no longer deems it productive for you to complete the scheme

 If you lose your enrolment in the scheme, you also lose your right to employment scheme benefits.

 You must submit an employment status form every 14 days.

  Employment scheme benefits are calculated based on the information you have provided to NAV on your work registration card.

Employment scheme benefits do not count toward your pension.

If your income or family and/or work situation changes, and/or you are planning a stay abroad, this may significantly affect monetary support paid by NAV. That is why you must report any changes to NAV immediately.
