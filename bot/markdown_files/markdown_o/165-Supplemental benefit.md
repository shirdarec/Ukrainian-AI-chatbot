#Supplemental benefit
Support for childcare and expenses you have in connection with education or job search.
You can receive supplemental benefit if you are taking an education that NAV has assessed as necessary in order for you to be able to get a job and support yourself. This also applies if you are registered with NAV as a real job seeker.

 To be eligible for supplemental benefits, you must also meet at least one of the conditions below:

 * You have impaired work capability due to illness and are participating in an employment scheme.
* You are a single parent and are taking an approved education or are registered with NAV as a real job seeker, and you meet the criteria for transitional allowance.
* You are a previous family caretaker and are taking an approved education.
* You are a surviving spouse and are taking an approved education or are registered with NAV as a real job seeker as an occupational activity.
* You are participating in an employment market scheme.
* You are a job seeker and are without work in the place you live through no fault of your own.

 Normally you will get benefit from the day you applied. In some cases, we can grant back-payment of supplemental benefit for up to three months. You need to apply before we can assess whether you are entitled to this.

 You can [contact NAV](/kontaktoss/en) for more information and guidance, and/or help filling out the form.

You will receive a written decision once your application has been processed. 

#### More about

  You must be in work-oriented activity or approved education to be entitled to supplemental benefits. If you do not completed your activity, you will lose your benefit.

 You must inform us about changes, such as if you:

 * cancel a labour market schemes, education, or courses
* have changes in your travel route, family situation, or childcare expenses
* plan a stay abroad

 This may affect the amount you receive from us.
