#Child support
Child support when the parents do not live together.
### The child has its permanent residence with one parent

 When the child has its permanent residence with one parent, this parent is the custodial parent and is the child support recipient. The other parent is the non-custodial parent, and the child support debtor. This parent normally has visiting arrangements with the child.

 When the non-custodial parent has visits from the child, they also incur costs in connection with the visit. A deduction will be made from the child support amount when the non-custodial parent has visiting arrangements with the child for more than two days per month.  
   
 Both parents have a duty to support the child. The custodial parent supports the child by covering the child’s costs, and the non-custodial parent supports the child by making a monthly child support payment.

 ### The child has divided residence

 Some parents who live in separate homes choose to have their child live permanently in both homes. Since the child can only have one legal address registered in the National Population Register, the parents must sign an agreement for sharing the child's residence pursuant to Section 36 of the Children Act. This is a legally binding agreement.  
   
 You can read more about dual domicile [on the webpage of the Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (in Norwegian)](https://www.bufdir.no/familie/samlivsbrudd/bosted-samvar-og-tidsfordeling/).  
   
 Parents who do not live together and who have children together under the age of 16 must complete an obligatory mediation session with the Family Counselling Service to decide where the child will live on a permanent basis.   
   
 When you, as parents, choose to have your child living permanently in two homes, the Family Counselling Service can help you draw up this agreement, or you can do so privately.  
   
 Where child support is concerned, having a dual domicile means: 

 * NAV considers that both parents shall pay equal costs for the child
* the parent with the highest income should pay child support
* parents can share the child support

 ### The child is in the care of child welfare services or other third party

 When the authorities have taken over custody of a child, and the Child Welfare Services has placed the child in a foster home or institution, the parents normally do not have to pay child support to each other. 

 When the municipality covers the expenses of the child, the municipality may demand a [fostering contribution from one or both parents](https://www.nav.no/oppfostringsbidrag) (in Norwegian).  
   
 If the child lives with someone other than his parents, such as a grandparent, that person will receive the child support. Both parents still have a duty to support the child, and the former beneficiary or NAV can decide that the payment be made to grandparent.

 ### The child is under 18 years old

 Normally, child support is a private matter, and the parents can agree on an amount and other concerns in a private agreement signed by both parties.

 The child has a right to be supported by both parents. The parent who does not live with the child must help support the child by paying child support.

 When the child has divided residence, it is considered that both parents hva equal costs for the child. If the parents have income differences, the one with the highest income must pay child support.

 ### The child is over 18 years old

 After age 18, the child may be entitled to support until they complete upper secondary education. The child may agree on an amount with one or both parents. In this case, the adult child is the one signing the agreement with their parent(s).

 ### If a private agreement is reached, NAV does not need to be involved.

 When you reach a private agreement on child support, it is not necessary to inform or involve NAV. As child support is a private matter, NAV will not get involved unless at least one party requests that NAV fix, change or collect the child support on your behalf.

 By coming to a private agreement on child support, you will have a much more flexible agreement than if NAV is involved. With a private agreement, you can change and adjust the payment as needed. In addition, you do not have to pay a fee for NAV to calculate the child support amount on your behalf.

 ### What must be included in the agreement?

 If you do not want to use the form prepared by NAV, the agreement should include the following:which child the agreement concerns:

 * the agreed amount to be paid per month
* whether you want to settle privately or whether you want the Tax Administration to collect the payment
* which time frame the agreement is valid for (date from/to)
* signatures from both parties

 ### **When the Child Welfare Services has custody of the child**

 In cases where the Child Welfare Services has custody of a child, it is not appropriate to enter into a private agreement.

 NAV has a child support calculator which is currently only available in Norwegian. For help and guidance, contact us at 55 55 33 33. With this calculator, you can calculate the child support amount yourself. This calculator uses the same rules as NAV does when calculating the child support amount.

 We recommend that you go through the calculator together, because there is a quite a lot of information that must be added by both parents. The calculation is based on the information entered into the calculator. This means the information you enter must be accurate, because the outcome will depend on the information you put in.

 If you are using the calculator to calculate child support for a child over 18, there are a couple of things to keep in mind:

 * If the child has its permanent residence with one parent, this parent must be added as the “custodial parent”.
* If the child has not yet turned 18, you can enter a fictitious birth date that would make the child 18 years old.

 NAV has a visiting arrangement calculator which is currently only available in Norwegian. For help and guidance, contact us at 55 55 33 33.

 When NAV calculates child support, deductions are made when the non-custodial parent has a visiting arrangement with the child for more than two days per month. This is because the non-custodial parent then incurs the cost of visits from the child, such as the cost of food. The calculator can help you figure out which visiting arrangement class to apply in your calculation of child support.

 Add the regular visiting arrangement through the year, plus visits during holidays.

 ### Divided residence

 Normally, deductions for visiting arrangement are not made if the child has divided residence.  
   
 However, the actual circumstances will be a determining factor even when there is an agreement stating that the child has divided residence. If there is deviation from the agreement, NAV may calculate child support as if the child did not have divided residence.

 The Children Act specifies that parents have a duty to support the child according to their financial circumstances. When NAV calculates child support, we apply what it costs to provide for a child, based on the child’s age. This is called maintenance cost. Child support is the non-custodial parent’s share of the maintenance cost.

 The parent with the highest income shall cover a larger share of the maintenance cost than the parent with the lowest income. If the child has a personal income, this may also be taken into account. We also assess how much the non-custodial parent is able to pay in child support, while still having enough money to support themselves. This is called the ability to pay.

 ### Fixed rates for maintenance cost and ability to pay

 When NAV calculates child support, the Children Act requires us to use rates and fixed amounts based by the National Institute for Consumer Research (SIFO). These rates have been prepared as an average of the cost to maintain a child at different ages..

 The maintenance cost increases as the child grows older. There are four age categories:

 * Age 0–5
* Ages 6–10
* Ages 11–14
* Age 15 and up

 In cases where NAV has calculated the amount and the Tax Administration is collecting it, the rate will automatically be adjusted on 1 July the years the child turns 6, 11 and 15 years old.

 There are also rates for how much the non-custodial parent needs to provide for themselves and any children of theirs in their own household.  
   
 As child support calculated by NAV is based on figures from SIFO, we do not take into account costs that exceed the fixed amounts.

 ### Indexing of child support

 If not otherwise decided by administrative decision, judgment or private agreement between the parties, the child support shall be indexed annually. The index date is 1 July.

 ### **Calculations for divided residence**

 When the parents have agreed to share permanent residence for a child pursuant to Section 36 of the Children Act, NAV considers that both parents shall pay equal costs for the child. Because you are going to divide maintenance costs proportionately according to income, child support may be appropriate when one parent earns more than the other.

 This means that the parent with the highest income shall pay a larger proportion of the total cost of maintenance cost.  
   
 In the case of dual domicile, the parents generally pay 50 percent each of the maintenance cost. When one earns more than the other, the person with a high income shall pay a net contribution for the income that exceeds 50 percent.

 **Example:**  
 Suzy lives equally with both parents, Tim and Karen. Tim earns NOK 400 000 per year, while Karen earns NOK 600 000 per year. 

 In this case, Karen must pay child support to Tim, because she earns 60 percent of their total income of NOK 1 000 000. Karen already pays 50 percent of the maintenance cost. She must also pay the part that exceeds 50 percent, i.e. 10 percent more, which goes as child support to Tim.

 ### **When the child lives in a foster home or institution**

 When the authorities have taken over custody of a child, and e.g. the Child Welfare Services has placed the child in a foster home or institution, the parents normally do not have to pay child support to each other. 

 When the municipality covers the child’s expenses, the municipality may demand a [fostering contribution from one or both parents (in Norwegian).](https://www.nav.no/oppfostringsbidrag)

 The maintenance cost includes

 * consumer expenses (clothing, shoes, food & drinks, leisure activities, etc)
* housing costs (child’s share of housing costs)
* child-care costs (kindergarten, after-school programme (SFO), nanny)

 The ordinary child benefit will be deducted, because this is meant to be put toward support of the child.

 **Consumer expenses:**  
 When NAV calculates child support, we base our assessment on the National Institute for Consumer Research (SIFO) Reference Budget for Consumer Expenditures. This reference budget shows ordinary budget items, based on a reasonable and acceptable level of consumption, as an indication of average costs for children of different ages. The budget item prices are updated on 1 July every year.

 **Housing costs:**  
 The child’s share of housing costs are included in the maintenance cost. NAV will apply a fixed amount for housing costs, based on the average of actual housing costs from Statistics Norway consumer surveys.

 These expenditures are included: interest on mortgages, rent, insurance, taxes and charges, maintenance, electricity and heating. Mortgage instalments are not included.

 **Child-care costs:**  
 Child-care costs are documented expenditures for child care, such as kindergarten, nanny and after-school programmes (SFO/AKS). The custodial parent’s child-care costs, if relevant, are added to the maintenance cost. If the non-custodial parent pays some of the child-care cost, we cannot add it to the calculation. NAV distinguishes between full-time child care and part-time child care. Full-time child care is a regular child supervision arrangement of 33 hours or more per week.

 For children under school-age, the rates are based on Statistics Norway parent payment surveys.

 For school-age children who have been enrolled in an after-school programme (SFO/AKS) or similar child supervision schemes, the rates are based on the Statistics Norway KOSTRA survey. This distinguishes between supervision up to 10 hours per week and supervision between 10 and 25 hours per week.

 When the custodial parent is not a recipient of child care benefit, actual child supervision costs are applied, up to a maximum. Parental allowances are included in this calculation.

 If parents pay extra for food (food fee), this will not be included.

 When we calculate the parents’ incomes, we consider

 * ·gross personal income. This includes earned income from an employer, including holiday pay, overtime pay and other supplements, as well as other taxable benefits from insurance policies, use of vehicles, telephone and media
* care benefit paid by the municipality, director’s remuneration, private pension and insurance payouts.
* positive net investment income exceeding NOK 10,000. This includes such things as dividend, interest income and proceeds from the sale of real property.
* taxable monetary payments from NAV. This includes sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, work assessment allowance, disability benefit or transitional benefit.
* other monetary payments from NAV. This includes, cash-for-care benefit, extended child benefit and extra infant supplement for single parents granted to the custodial parent for the child being supported.

 ### Discretionary calculation

 If your income is significantly lower than your earning potential, we need information from you explaining why that is. That is because we need to assess whether there is a reasonable reason for your income being lower.

 If we find that you have no reasonable reason to earn less than your earning potential, we may calculate your income at our discretion. That means we estimate what your income could have been, based on your education, work experience and past income level.

 ### Child supplement

 If one parent is receiving a child supplement to a benefit from NAV for the child for whom child support is to be paid, such as disability benefit or work assessment allowance (AAP), this could affect the calculation in various ways:

 * The child supplement is considered income for the parent who receives it.
* If the non-custodial parent does not have full ability to pay child support, the child supplement will be applied as child support. Tax on the child supplement will be deducted.
* NAV may, on its own initiative, calculate child support when a non-custodial parent receives child supplement.

 When NAV calculates child support, we take into account how much the non-custodial parent is able to pay in child support, while still having enough money left over to provide for themselves and any children of theirs in the household.

 If you are the non-custodial parent and you have a low income, your child support payments may be reduced or even set to NOK 0. The child support payment can never exceed the non-custodial parent’s ability to pay it. If the non-custodial parent pays child support to more than one custodial parent and does not have sufficient income to cover all child support payments, the child support may be reduced. The amount the non-custodial parent is able to pay will then be distributed across all custodial parent recipients.

 If the non-custodial parent’s income is insufficient to pay full child support for all children, the child support payments will be reduced to what he/she is able to pay. The amount the non-custodial parent can pay will be distributed between the children.

 ### How does NAV assess the ability to pay child support?

 We use fixed rates when we assess someone’s ability to pay child support. This means that we are not able to take into account your specific debt level and other expenditures. Click here for an overview of the rates We take the following into account:

 * Tax rate and social security contributions are calculated based on ordinary rates for salary and wage earners.
* Subsistence costs are divided into two different rates. There is one rate for non-custodial parents who live alone, and a somewhat lower rate if the non-custodial parent shares their home with another person.
* The rate applied for caring for own children within the non-custodial parent’s household, is an average rate for all age groups. The standard rates applied include consumer expenditures, housing costs, child-care costs and child benefit. These are the same rates we apply when we calculate maintenance cost.
* The rates for housing costs are taken from the Statistics Norway consumer survey. There is one rate for non-custodial parents who live alone, and another rate if the non-custodial parent shares their home with another person.

 Other maximum limits on how much a non-custodial parent can be ordered to pay The non-custodial parent cannot be ordered to pay more than

 * 5/6, or 83.3 percent, of the child’s maintenance cost.
* 25 percent of the gross income estimated by NAV before making deductions for visiting arrangements, if relevant.

 When NAV calculates child support, we also take into account if the child has personal income. The child’s income is only taken into account if the annual income exceeds NOK . 

 The child is considered self-supporting if their income exceeds NOK . In these cases, we will not order the non-custodial parent to pay child support.

 When the non-custodial parent has a visiting arrangement with the child, they also incur costs in connection with the visits. This means the non-custodial parent is entitled to deductions from the child support payment.

 Visiting arrangement deductions apply when there is an agreement, either verbal or written, outlining a regular visit schedule, and the parties comply with this schedule. This also applies to visiting arrangements regulated by order or administrative decision. This includes settlements in court, judgments and agreements imposed by the County Governor.

 ### Expenditures included in the visiting arrangement deduction:

 * · food and drinks
* · health and hygiene
* · play and leisure activities
* · transport
* · housing costs (visiting arrangement classes 3 and 4)

 Travel costs in connection with visits are not part of the child support.  
   
   
 **What if a visiting arrangement schedule exists, but the schedule is not followed?**  
 There may be several reasons why visiting arrangements are not followed, even if there is a schedule for it. If it’s not followed through, the non-custodial parent does not incur costs in connection with visits , and will therefore not be granted a visiting arrangement deduction.  
   
 If there is a judgment, court settlement or binding agreement in place for visiting arrangement, and visits does not happen due to disagreement between the parties, the other parent may file a claim for so-called enforcement damages with the district court. 

 **If a child has been abducted**  
 If a child has been abducted, Skatteetaten may stop child support payments. In order for NAV to be able to process the case as an abduction case, NAV must receive notice of child abduction from the Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Bufdir) or the police.

 The child is the one who is entitled to the child support, and the non-custodial parent must therefore continue to pay the child support as before, but the money is put into a frozen account for the child. The child will get access to the frozen account when they turn 18 years old.

 When parents establish a private agreement, the parents decide between themselves what the child support shall cover.  
   
 When NAV calculates the child support, the child support payment is intended to cover expenditures that are included in the maintenance cost. In short, these are costs that a parent incurs in connection caring for the child in their day-to-day life. This means food and drinks, clothing and shoes, housing and child-care costs, and play and leisure activities.. 

 The National Institute for Consumer Research (SIFO) decides what is included in the maintenance cost.  
   
 Read more about what [SIFO specifically includes in the maintenance cost](https://www.oslomet.no/en/about/sifo/reference-budget) on their website. Scroll down the page until you get to the headline “Additional information on the different consumption areas”.  
   
 We refer to SIFO’s website, because they are the ones who define the items that go into the maintenance cost, and their site will be updated if there are any changes.

 The custodial parent manages the child support payment on behalf of the child. That means that it is also the custodial parent who decides what the support payment will be used for in the day-to-day care of the child. When the non-custodial parent has paid the determined amount, they cannot be ordered to pay any more in child support per month.

 Many families, however, incur costs relating to the child that exceed what the child support payment covers. These are costs that are not considered part of the day-to-day caring for the child. This includes travel costs in connection with holidays or visiting arrangements , gifts, pocket money, celebrations, or expensive leisure activities.  
   
 What is expensive for one family may not be expensive for another, and this is not something NAV can intervene in or decide for you. In these cases, it will be up to the parents to agree on what, if anything, to pay outside of the monthly child support payment

 ### Support for extraordinary expenses

 Extraordinary expenses are necessary expenses that are not covered by the monthly child support payment. The parent who incurs costs in connection with dental braces, eyeglasses or the child’s confirmation, for example, may request that the other parent pay their share of these expenses.

 When you apply for support to pay extraordinary expenses, NAV will set an amount for the other parent to pay. NAV is not covering these expenses.

 ### Travel costs in connection with visiting arrangement

 Travel costs in connection with visiting arrangement are not covered by the monthly child support. How such travel costs are shared is a private matter between the parents. You negotiate a distribution of these travel costs that you believe is best for your situation.  
   
 If you do not agree otherwise, travel costs are divided proportionately between you in accordance with your respective incomes. This means that the parent with the highest income shall cover a larger share of the travel costs than the parent with the lowest income.  
   
 Under some, limited circumstances you may request that NAV decide the distribution of travel costs, but NAV cannot collect this money on your behalf.

 If you cannot come to a private agreement on child support, one or both of you may request that NAV calculate the child support.

 ### Over 18 years old:

 Normally, the child is the one who must apply after they turn 18 years old. However, the custodial parent may apply on the child’s behalf before they turn 18 years old, if preferable In that case the custodial parent must pay a fee of NOK  for the service.

 Once the child turns 18 years old, they will become the child support recipient in their case. If the former custodial parent, or a third party, is applying on behalf of the child after the child has turned 18 years old, the application must include a power of attorney from the 18-year-old.

 ### Litt om saksgang og virkningstidspunkt

 Child support is normally first calculated for the calendar month during which the application was made. If an application for adjustment is later submitted, the adjustment will take effect from the month following the month during which the application was made.  
   
 When one of you have submitted an application, the other party will receive notification that NAV is calculating child support. The notification will include information about the process. All parties involved will get an opportunity to give a statement before NAV makes a decision.  
   
 If one of the parties chooses to not give a statement, we will use the information and documentation we have available.  
   
 NAV is an objective party in this process. Child support is a sensitive and difficult issue for many. We do understand, but we will base our calculation on fixed rates and the available documentation

 ### Would you like to apply?

 Submit your application digitally or on paper.

 If you want NorwegianTax Administration to collect and manage child support payments, tick the appropriate box in the application form.

 ### What does it cost to have NAV calculate the child support?

 When NAV calculates or adjusts the child support, we collect a fee from both the custodial and the non-custodial parent. We do this because child support is normally a private matter, but one we can handle for you as a service.  
   
 The fee is NOK , which is equivalent to one court fee.

 #### Is it possible to get the fee waived?

 You will not have to pay the fee if your gross income is less than NOK 331 200.

 **When will a fee be imposed?**  
 You must pay a fee when NAV calculates child support in response to an application from one parent, but you will also incur an additional fee each time one of request adjustment of the child support.

 You must also pay a fee when NAV calculates the child support on our own initiative. We may do this when the custodial parent receives an advance on the child support, or when the parents did not live together when the child was born and have not reached a private agreement.  
   
 **Is there a fee for international cases?**  
 You must pay a fee if you or the other parent live abroad, if not otherwise prohibited by agreement with that country.

 **How to pay the fee?**  
 The Norwegian Tax Administration will collect the fee. The parents will receive an invoice.

 #### Adjust a private agreement

 When you have established a private agreement on child support, you may agree adjustments or amendments to this agreement without involving NAV.

 If you have opted to have Norwegian Tax Administration collect the child support payments on your behalf, you simply send a copy of the new agreement to us.

 #### Adjust child support calculated by NAV

 For NAV to adjust the child support, the new calculation must lead to an adjustment exceeding 12 percent. The adjustment normally takes effect from the month after the claim for adjustment was filed.

 Both parents must pay a fee for NAV to perform this service for you. The fee is NO , which is equivalent to one court fee.

 #### Automatic adjustment of child support

 In cases where NAV has calculated the child support and is collecting it, the rate will automatically be adjusted in the years the child turns 6, 11 and 15 years old. This means it will not be necessary to request an adjustment in these cases.

 ### Want to request an adjustment?

 ### Under 18 years old

 The duty to pay child support normally lapses at the end of the month when the child turns 18 years old. After age 18, the child may be entitled to support until they complete upper secondary education.

 If Norwegian Tax Administration is collecting and paying the child support, this arrangement will automatically cease when the child turns 18, if the child has not applied for child support through upper secondary education.

 #### How to cease payment of child support before the child turns 18

 There are several reasons for ending child support payments before the child turns 18, or to request that Norwegian Tax Administration cease collection and payment of the child support. For NAV to decide to end child support or the collection of child support, NAV must receive a notification to that effect.

 Examples include situations where the child has moved to the former non-custodial parent, where the child becomes self-supporting, or where child welfare services has taken care and control of the child.

 ### Over 18 years old

 When NAV calculates child support for a child who is over 18 years old, the child support arrangement will normally remain in place until such time the child is expected to graduate from upper secondary education. If there is some doubt as to whether the child will be enrolled in a programme throughout their upper secondary education, we will consider calculating child support for one year at a time.

 Child support payments will automatically cease when the time period specified in the decision ends. If the child is delayed in their education, NAV will consider whether the conditions for extended child support have been met.

 The child is considered self-supporting if their income exceeds NOK . In this case, the child will not be entitled to child support. If the child’s income exceeds this amount in the child support period, one of the parties must notify NAV.

 If child support payments should cease, e.g. because the parents have entered into a private agreement with the 18-year-old, or the child drops out of school, the parents must notify NAV of this. The parent paying child support may submit a copy of the agreement, or the child over 18 may give notification that child support payments should cease.

 When NAV calculates child support, both parents have a mutual right of access to any and all information used by NAV. All information you submit in connection with the case will be made available to the other parent. That is because both parents are part of the same case, and both parents have the right to give a statement on the case.  
   
 You must keep confidential all information to which you become privy in connection with the case, and you may not use or release this information in other contexts.

 #### Other parties may get access

 In some cases, the child support cases of others are affected by your case, and vice versa. This could, for example, be when the non-custodial parent has children with more than one custodial parent and is unable to pay full child support to all children.  
   
 In this case, the affected child support cases will trigger rights of access to all parties involved. That is because a collective assessment must be made for all cases, to ensure that the distribution of the child support is fair. In these cases, you must also keep this information confidential.

 ### **The Tax Administration collects and pays the support**

 It is the Norwegian Tax Administration that collects and pays child support and advance payments. You must therefore contact them regarding questions about payments. [You can read more about their services online (skatteetaten.no)](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/Payment-and-collection/child-maintenance-and-other-maintenance-payments/) or contact them by phone 21 05 11 00.  
 NAV cannot answer these questions.

 When you have entered into a private agreement, you may transfer the contribution privately between you. You can request the Tax Administration to administrate the child support payments. This means the Tax Administration will collect child support from the person who is obligated to pay the contribution, and pay this to the beneficiary (the custodial parent). There is no cost to have the Tax Administration collect the contribution.

 The Tax Administration can administrate the contribution for private agreements and when NAV has determined the contribution.

 Child support shall, at the earliest, be paid from the first month the parents no longer live together.  
   
 If the parents have a private agreement, the child support shall be paid monthly in advance, if not otherwise agreed. You decide the date by which child support shall be paid.

 When the Tax Administration is handling collection of the child support, the non-custodial parent must make payment no later than the 25th of the month prior to the month the child support is for.

 You can find information about payments from the Tax Administration in your online banking solution. To see detailed information about the payment, you must log in to your online bank from a computer. Banking apps on smart devices may not permit you to view details.  
   
 Remember that you can activate notifications from your online bank, so that you can be notified when the payment has been deposited into your account.

 Skatteetaten will use the account number you have registered with NAV as the account for the child support payment. Check which bank account number you have registered on nav.no.

 ### Ferie og feriepenger

  ### Skatt

  ### Annual report

 When child support is paid for a child under the age of 18, the Tax Administration will issue a certificate of pay and tax deducted for the child support paid. The certificate is always issued in the child’s name, even when another parent, caregiver or institution has been the recipient of the payment.

 ### What happens if the non-custodial parent fails to pay child support?

 If the non-custodial parent fails to pay on time, the Tax Administration will automatically follow up on the matter. They will issue a reminder for the outstanding payment. The reminder will

 be issued on the 10th of the following month, with 14 days allowed for payment. If the reminder also goes unpaid, another reminder will be issued, along with a notice of forced collection. This reminder also allows 14 days for payment.

 Once the time allowed for payment on the notice of forced collection has expired, the Tax Administration will actively check whether the non-custodial parent has an income, such as earned income or monetary support from NAV. If so, an attachment of earnings will be ordered. This means the employer will be forced to make deductions from the pay, or NAV will make deductions from the monetary support.

 The attachment of earnings will be equivalent to the monthly child support payment, or relevant debt settlement arrangement. When the Tax Administration issues an attachment order, they will also take into account whether the non-custodial parent is paying off debt. The non-custodial parent must have enough money for subsistence and other necessary expenses. If Skatteetaten does not find that the non-custodial parent has an income, other measures will be considered. These include execution liens or distress levied by the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner.

 When an employer has been ordered to attach earnings, the employer is obligated to inform  the Tax Administration of any changes to the employment relationship. This includes situations where the non-custodial parent resigns or is placed on sick leave. If the non-custodial parent gets a new employer, the attachment of earnings is transferred to the new employer.

 The Tax Administration will take into consideration that the non-custodial parent must have enough money to support themselves. They will apply their own subsistence rates, which are different from the ones applied by NAV in their assessment of the ability to pay child support.

   
 

 ### Betalingsordning

 The non-custodial parent may enter into [a debt settlement arrangement for child support debt](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/Payment-and-collection/child-maintenance-and-other-maintenance-payments/) with the Tax Administration.

 Debt settlement must be paid in addition to the monthly child support payment.

 If NAV has registered debt owed by the non-custodial parent, The Tax Administration will automatically make deductions from payments, such as tax refunds and retroactive payments from NAV.

 #### Cancellation of child support debt

 If a non-custodial parent fails to pay child support, child support debt will accumulate with NAV. The non-custodial parent may apply for relief from this debt.

 NAV will only grant debt relief if compelling circumstances are present. Among other things, NAV will consider whether the non-custodial parent will be able to repay this debt now or in the future.

 * If it is likely that the non-custodial parent can improve their earning ability in the future, NAV will not grant debt relief.
* If the non-custodial parent’s annual income is lower than 75 times the increased advance, and it is clear that the income will not improve with time, NAV may grant relief from all of the child support debt. NAV will also assess whether the non-custodial parent has any assets before they will consider granting debt relief.
* If the income is more than 75 times the increased advance, NAV will not grant complete debt relief. NAV may still, however, consider partial relief from the child support debt.

 #### How to apply for cancellation of child support debt?

 The non-custodial parent may apply for relief from child support debt.

 Normally, the non-custodial parent may apply to NAV for cancellation from child support debt.

 If the child support debt concerns a child who has turned 18 years old, the child may choose to release the non-custodial parent from their debt (cancel the debt).

 A custodial parent cannot cancel child support debt on behalf of a child under the age of 18, because the child is entitled to the support.

 In addition, the estate of the non-custodial parent (if the non-custodial parent dies), or heirs who have assumed liability for the debt may apply for debt relief.

 #### Advance payment of child support

 Advance payment is a means-tested monetary support, which will be paid if the child support payment cannot be collected.

 The child has a right to be supported by both parents. This includes situations when one of the parents, or the child, lives abroad.  
   
 Child support can be calculated, or adjusted, in three different ways. The parents can

 * reach a private agreement on child support
* apply for NAV to calculate the child support
* apply to have the child support decided in the country where the non-custodial parent lives

 In most other countries, child support is decided in a judgment or court settlement.  
   
 If you want the child support to be decided in the country where the other parent lives, you can contact the proper authorities/courts in this country. If Norway has a cooperative agreement in place with this country in the area of child support, we can help you send the application to the proper authority.  
   
 **Countries bound by the Lugano Convention**  
 The countries bound by the Lugano Convention include the EU and the EFTA states Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.  
   
 If one of the parents lives in one of these countries, the parent claiming child support must normally apply to the authorities in the country where the other parent lives. There is an exception for custodial parents, who can choose whether to make a claim for child support in the country where they live, or in the country where the non-custodial parent lives.  
   
 The non-custodial parent does not have the same option. If a non-custodial parent wants to request a child support calculation or adjustment in Norway, but the custodial parent lives in a country bound by the Lugano Convention, NAV may only process this request if the custodial parent consents to this. If not, the request must be processed in the country where the custodial parent lives.

 #### How does NAV calculate child support in international cases?

 The child support is calculated by a discretionary assessment when one parent, or the child, lives abroad.  
   
 The cost of living in the country where the custodial parent lives will be taken into account. NAV also takes into account income levels, exchange rates and purchasing power.  
   
 A fee will be incurred for this service, unless prohibited by agreements between the two countries. The fee is NOK  which is equivalent to one court fee.

 All parties to a child support case may appeal NAV’s decision. If a child is a party, the child must be 18 years or older to appeal.

 The term of appeal is 3 weeks from the date on which you received the decision.

 The decision has been made based on the information available at the time. If the information is incorrect, you may appeal the decision. If the information changes after the date of the decision, you can reapply for an adjustment.

 ### Appeal process

 When you appeal a decision, the NAV unit that made your decision, will review your case. If the unit finds no reason to amend its decision, the appeal will be forwarded to NAV Appeals. The appellate authority will then make its decision, and this decision will be final.

 In order to get this decision reviewed, you must bring the matter before a court of law. You may also appeal to the Parliamentary Ombud.

 There is one form for the custodial parent and another for the non-custodial parent. With these forms, you can apply for calculation or adjustment of child support.  
   
 The questions on the application, along with the requested documentation, will provide us with what we need to process your application. If we need additional information, we will contact you.
