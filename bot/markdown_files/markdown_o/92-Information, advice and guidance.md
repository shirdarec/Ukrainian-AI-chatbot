#Information, advice and guidance
Guidance from NAV when you have challenges related to your situation at home, your living situation, caring for children, work or finances.
Contact your NAV office if you need advice and guidance.

 You do not need to already be in a difficult situation to use this service. Nor do you need to qualify for benefits from NAV to ask for a meeting to get advice and guidance. We will offer you counselling based on your needs.

 We have a duty to advise you about services and benefits that you are entitled to.

 If you need help from other public services, we can help you get in touch with them.

 If you want, we can collaborate with various other public services to ensure you get the best possible help. Examples of other public services we can coordinate with include schools, doctors, the follow-up service (“oppfølgingstjenesten”), the child welfare service (“barnevernet”), the child and adolescent psychiatric service (BUP), and district psychiatric centres (DPS).

 If you are [receiving financial social assistance](https://www.nav.no/sosialhjelp/en), a counselling session may help you be able to manage better on your own.

 NAV can also provide you with financial advice and debt counselling. You can talk to us over the phone or meet us in person at your local NAV office (text in Norwegian).

  All NAV employees are bound by a duty of confidentiality.

 The counselling session will be held in a place where you will not be disturbed. You can choose whether you want to have the session in person at the NAV office or online.
