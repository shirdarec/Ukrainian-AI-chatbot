#Transitional benefit for survivors
Secures income when the marriage has lasted less than 5 years and you have no children together, or if you have daily care for the deceased's children.
You may be entitled to transitional benefit for a surviving spouse or partner if:

 * the marriage lasted less than 5 years and you and the deceased did not have joint children
* you are in a period of restructuring as a result of your spouse or spousal equivalent’s death
* you are taking education that will improve your opportunities to start working. NB: You must start the education within 2 years of the deceased’s death
* you have the daily care of children that the deceased had with another partner (children from a previous relationship). NB: The care must have started before the deceased died and have continued without interruption

 If you remarry or have a child with a new cohabiting partner, you will no longer be entitled to transitional benefit for a surviving spouse.

    ### How does earned income from work affect transitional benefit?

 Transitional benefit for survivors will be reduced if you have or can be expected to have your own earned income. 

     If you are working, have children, are a genuine job seeker, are going to school or are studying, you may also be entitled to more support from NAV.

 Some people may also be entitled to a survivor’s pension from a private occupational pension scheme.

  How long you can receive transitional benefit for survivors for depends on the duration of the marriage and whether you are responsible for caring for children.

 If the marriage lasted less than 12 months, the main rule is that you can receive transitional benefit for survivors for a transitional period of up to 6 months.

 If the marriage lasted longer than 12 months, the main rule is that you can receive transitional benefit for survivors for a transitional period of up to 12 months.

 If you were married for less than 5 years and you have the daily care of the deceased’s children from a previous relationship, you may be entitled to transitional benefit for survivors up until the month in which the child turns 18.

 NB: The care must have started before the deceased died and have continued without interruption. If your marriage and daily care of the deceased’s children have together lasted more than 5 years, you may be entitled to survivor’s pension.

 See payment dates.

                ### Moving to Norway

  You can apply online or on paper. If you apply online, you do not need to submit documentation. 

  ### For persons who are receiving transitional benefit as a surviving spouse before 2024

 If you are already receiving transitional benefit, you will keep the benefit for the remainder of your benefit period. If you are also a caregiver for a child under age 18, you may keep the benefit for 3 years. The benefit may be extended by up to 2 years, if you need help finding employment, such as completing an education or work training.

 If you were born in 1969 or earlier, you are a caregiver for a child under age 18, and you have had a low earned income for the past five years, you may keep the transitional benefit for 5 years. After that, the transitional benefit will be converted to an adjustment allowance, which may entail that your payments change. This benefit is paid until you turn 67 years old.

 ### New rules for survivors from 2024

 The transitional benefit for survivors is being replaced by an adjustment allowance. The allowance is intended to guarantee an income and to help you help yourself in an adjustment period after the death. After 6 months, you will normally be expected to have found employment or be participating in another type of activity, so that you can eventually provide for yourself.

 These changes will likely take effect from 1 January 2024.

 ### What is an adjustment allowance?

 * A time-limited benefit that normally only lasts 3 years.
* The benefit may be extended by up to 2 years, if you need help finding employment, such as completing an education or work training.
* If you were born in 1962 or earlier and you had a low earned income in the last five years before the death, you may keep the benefit until you turn 67 years old.
* The benefit is 2.25 times the National Insurance basic amount G, currently NOK , depending on the period of national insurance coverage for the person who died.
* If your income exceeds 0.5 times G (currently NOK ), the benefit will be reduced.
* The benefit is regarded as pensionable income.
