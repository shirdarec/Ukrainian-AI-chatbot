#Cash-for-care benefit
Cash-for-care benefit can be granted if you have children between the ages of 1 and 2 years, who do not attend kindergarten full time.
To qualify for cash-for-care benefit, your child must have turned 1 year old and cannot attend a publicly funded kindergarten full time.

 If your child attends kindergarten part-time, you may be entitled to 20, 40, 60, or 80 per cent cash-for-care benefit.

 Generally, both you and the child must live in Norway. If your child is in Norway for at least 12 consecutive months, the child is considered a resident. Separate rules apply to EEA citizens.

 From 1 July 2017, you must also have been a member of the [Norwegian National Insurance Scheme](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme) for at least 5 years. If the child lives with both parents, 5 years membership is required for both parents.

 When NAV assesses the conditions for membership, social security periods in other EEA countries will also be considered. You must obtain documentation of these social security periods from the EEA countries in question.

 What qualifies as social security periods varies from country to country. For example, it may be place of residence, work periods, or both.

 Note that only EEA citizens and third-country nationals who are considered family members of EEA citizens can add social security periods from other EEA countries to periods in the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. If the social security periods are from another Nordic country, citizenship is irrelevant.

 If you live permanently with children who are not your own, you may be entitled to cash-for-care benefit. You cannot claim cash-for-care benefit for children who are in foster care or in an institution.

 ### Are you a foreign worker in Norway?

 There are some situations where you may be entitled to cash-for-care benefit as a foreign worker in Norway.

 If your child does not attend kindergarten at all, you may receive 100 per cent cash-for-care benefit, which is NOK  per month.

 If your child attends kindergarten part-time, you may be granted 20, 40, 60, or 80 per cent cash-for-care benefit.

 How much kindergarten time you have been granted determines how much you will receive in cash-for-care benefit, not how much time your child actually spends in kindergarten.

 #### Example:

 Your child has been granted a full-time place in kindergarten, but only attends one day a week. In this case, you will not be entitled to cash-for-care benefit, since your child has the opportunity to attend kindergarten full time.

 You can receive cash-for-care benefit for children between 1 and 2 years, i.e. starting the month the child turns 13 months, up until and including the month the child turns 23 months. You can receive cash-for-care benefits for a maximum of 11 months.

 If your child starts attending kindergarten, cash-for-care benefit is paid up until and including the month before the child has access to a kindergarten place.

 If you have adopted children, you can be granted cash-for-care benefit for a period of up to 11 months after the 100 per cent parental benefit period is over. The cash-for-care benefit period can be used until the child starts attending school.

 If you received a lump-sum grant upon adoption, you can, at the earliest, be granted cash-for-care benefit from the month after the 100 per cent parental benefit period for adoption would have expired.

 If you care for young children, you may accumulate pension rights for care work. This could contribute to a higher pension when you retire. Find out if you are entitled to [accumulation of pension rights for care work](/en/home/benefits-and-services/relatert-informasjon/accumulation-of-pension-rights-for-care-work).

 The application will specify which types of documentation and which attachments you must include.

 Please contact NAV if you need more information and guidance and/or help filling out the application.

 **If you and/or your child are foreign citizens**, you must provide documentation of a residence permit in Norway.

 **If you apply for cash- for-care benefit according to the EEA rules or the Nordic Convention**, you must attach:

 * your employment contract
* copy of the first page of your passport
* the child’s birth certificate
* supplementary form NAV 34-00.15.

 **If the child is not registered in the Norwegian population register**, you must provide the child’s birth certificate.

 **If the child is adopted**, you must attach documentation showing when you got custody of the child.

 **If the child has joint residence and you want to share payment**, you must attach the joint residence agreement. Both parents must apply. The joint residence agreement must be signed by both parents and dated.

 * If the child is not registered in the Norwegian population register: **A certificate from your country of residence confirming that you are the parent of the child you are applying for benefit for** (birth certificate). It is the population register or another competent authority in your country of residence that can provide you with a certificate.
* **ID number and address in your country of residence** for you, the child and the other parent.
* **Documentation of your employment** (copy of employment agreement).
* **Confirmation from another EEA country that you have been covered by a social security scheme for at least 5 years.** If you have been a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme for 5 years, you do not need to attach such confirmation. Periods of coverage in Norwegian and foreign social security schemes, respectively, can be added to achieve at least 5 years of social security coverage. Note that only citizens from EEA countries or third-country nationals who are family members of an EEA citizen can combine social security periods from other EEA countries with Norwegian social security periods. If the social security period is from another Nordic country, citizenship is irrelevant.

 ### If you are self-employed, you must attach:

 * Copies of order confirmations and invoices for the period before you became liable for VAT.
* Ledger overview for the period after you became liable for VAT.
* Printout from the Brønnøysund register confirming your role in the company.

 Once we have received your application, we will check the information you provided against public registers and kindergarten enrolment lists from your municipality.

 If you are an EEA citizen, NAV will usually collect information from your home country, among other things on whether you, or the other parent of the child, are receiving child benefit or equivalent benefits from this country.

 In some countries there is a central institution that will respond to these types of enquiries, whereas in others they are handled at regional or local levels. That is why you must specify the municipality and region, county, state or similar in which your family members live.

 If we have questions, we will contact you.

 You will receive a written decision when we have processed your application.

 Cash-for-care benefits are paid monthly.

 #### Holiday pay

 #### Tax

 You have to notify us if

 * your child will start attending kindergarten
* your family situation changes
* you are planning to stay or move abroad
* your employment situation abroad changes

 If your is about to start kindergarten, we need the following information:

 * the child’s date of birth
* the name of the kindergarten
* the date from which the child has been given a kindergarten place
* how many hours per week your child has been granted a kindergarten place for

 #### Travelling to another EEA country

 You may keep the cash-for-care benefit for up to 3 months if you and your family are staying abroad. The requirement is that you do not work during your stay.

 Generally, if you are planning on staying abroad for more than 3 months, the cash-for-care benefit will cease the month you leave Norway.

 If you are staying or moving to another EEA country, separate rules apply.

 You must notify NAV of which country you are travelling to and how long you are intending to stay there. If your stay abroad lasts longer than planned, you must also notify us.

 #### Staying in or moving to another EEA country

 The cash-for-care benefit will cease if the child moves abroad. You may, however, qualify for cash-for-care benefit if your child lives in another EEA country if

 * one parent is working in Norway, on the [Norwegian continental shelf](/en/home/work-and-stay-in-norway/employee-on-the-norwegian-continental-shelf) or on a [Norwegian ship (in Norwegian)](/no/person/flere-tema/arbeid-og-opphold-i-utlandet/jobbe-i-utlandet-og-folketrygden/arbeidstaker-pa-skip)
* both parents live with the child, and both parents are compulsory or voluntary [members of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme)
* one parent is receiving disability benefit or pension from Norway due to former work activity
* one parent is receiving sickness benefit, work assessment allowance or another activity-based benefit from Norway
* both parents live in Norway, while the child lives in a different EEA country

 You must apply specifically for cash-for-care benefit pursuant to EEA rules.

  If one of you works in another EEA country outside Norway, and the child lives in this country, the cash-for-care benefit will be paid from the country of employment.

 If this country’s cash-for-care benefit is lower than the Norwegian cash-for-care benefit, NAV will cover the difference.

 When NAV has received your application, we usually need to collect documentation from your country of residence. Among other things, we need to know whether you, or the other parent of the child, are receiving cash-for-care benefit or an equivalent benefit from this country.

 In some countries there is a central institution that will respond to these types of enquiries, whereas in others they are handled at regional or local levels. That is why you have to specify the municipality and region, county, state, or similar in which your family members live.
