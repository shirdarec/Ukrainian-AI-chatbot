#Basic benefit
Financial support for additional expenses when you or your child has a permanent injury, illness or disability.
Additional expenses are any expenses you or your child incur as a result of your/your child’s medical condition. The term medical condition refers to a permanent injury, illness or functional impairment.

 These additional expenses must remain for 2–3 years or more.

 If it is not possible to do a comparison with past expenses, NAV will compare your expenses with the expenses of other people for the same purpose.

 The basic benefit does not cover medication expenses.

 You must be a [member of Norwegian National Insurance](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme) to qualify for this benefit.

 The basic benefit has 6 different rates. Your total additional expenses determine which rate you or your child is eligible for.

 Your additional expenses must be equivalent to rate 1, which is NOK  per month.

 There is no age limit on the basic benefit.

 If your functional ability is impaired after the age of 70, you will not be entitled coverage of additional transport expenses.

 Your need for the benefit may change, which means that you may receive notice from NAV that we are reviewing the benefit.

 Please [contact NAV](/kontaktoss/en) if you need more information or counselling, and/or if you need help filling out the form.

**If you are applying for basic benefit due to additional wear on clothing and bedding,** you must document these additional expenses with receipts or a list of likely current additional expenses.

 Normally, you must document additional expenses with receipt for a period of at least 3 months. You must specify what the purchase is and the reason for buying it.

 You get access to the form “Hjelpeskjema - Ekstrautgifter til «slitasje på klær og sengetøy» NAV 06-03.11” when you fill out the application for basic benefit. 

 **If the wear on clothing is caused by your child having hyperkinetic disorders,** including ADHD with hyperactivity, you do not need to document additional expenses. The medical information must specify that your child has hyperactive behaviours that would explain the additional wear on clothing. It is not sufficient to specify a diagnostic code or diagnosis.

 **If your additional expenses are related to the use of taxis,** you must include receipts for a period of minimum 3 months.

 You will receive a written decision once NAV has considered your application. 

Basic benefits are paid monthly.

 If your need for the basic benefit changes, you must [notify NAV immediately](/endringer/en).
