#Supplemental benefit for single parents
Support for childcare and expenses you have for education or job hunting when you are alone with children.
You can receive supplemental benefit if you are a single parent and you are taking an [education that NAV has assessed as necessary](https://www.nav.no/overgangsstonad-enslig/en#utdanning) in order for you to be able to get a job and support yourself.

 The same applies if you are a [single parent and are registered with NAV as a job seeker](https://www.nav.no/overgangsstonad-enslig/en#arbeidssoker).

 Generally, you and the child must live in Norway to qualify for the benefit, and you must have been a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme for the last 5 years. Read more about staying or moving abroad, and exceptions to the membership requirement under [to and from abroad](/tilleggsstonader-enslig/en#to-and-from-abroad).

  ### Relocation

 As a single parent, you can get support for your relocation expenses if you must move to start a new job. You can receive this benefit for as long as you qualify for transitional benefit. The same applies if you have previously received transitional benefit and it is less than six months since the transitional benefit ceased.

   #### Rates for relocation

   You can receive supplemental benefit for as long as you qualify for transitional benefit, and you have expenses in connection with education or looking for work.

 ### Are you receiving or do you intend to apply for transitional benefit?

 Periods during which you receive benefit will be deducted from the period of transitional benefit if you receive supplemental benefit. This applies if:

  You must notify us of changes if:

 * you change, drop out of, or reduce the scope of your education or training
* you are no longer a job seeker
* you fall ill, and this prevents you from being in work, education or being a job seeker
* your application for separation or divorce is refused
* you start living with your partner, enter a civil partnership, or get married
* you start a relationship with someone you have previously lived with and have children with
* you are expecting another child
* the child access arrangements change
* the day-to-day care of the child is temporarily or permanently left to others
* you are going to [spend time abroad](https://www.nav.no/tilleggsstonader-enslig/en#abroad)
* you [move](https://www.nav.no/tilleggsstonader-enslig/en#relocation)
* the other parent moves very close to where you live, i.e., the same building, the same block of flats, next door, or a building around the same courtyard, etc.

 Periods spent abroad

 You can be abroad for up to six weeks, that is, 42 days, during a 12-month period while you are receiving this benefit. Weekend stays of up to two nights do not count.  
   
 You must notify us if:

 * you are going to spend more than six weeks abroad
* you are going to travel abroad and have already spent six weeks outside Norway during the past 12 months
* you are going to travel abroad, and this stay will result in you having spent more than six weeks abroad during the past 12 months

 See which rules apply under [to and from abroad](/tilleggsstonader-enslig/en#to-and-from-abroad).

  If you are moving or have moved, we must assess whether you are still entitled to this benefit.

 You must send us information about:

 * whether you still live alone or are sharing your home with another adult. If you live in a marriage-like relationship, we will need your partner’s name and date of birth
* whether your children are registered in the National Registry as living at your address after you have moved
* any changes to your child access agreement
* you have changed or interrupted your course of education or labour market scheme after moving  
 you are still a job seeker, if you were a job seeker before you moved
