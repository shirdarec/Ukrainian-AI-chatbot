#Benefit for former family caregivers
Ensures you have income if you cannot support yourself after the end of the period of care.
Are you unmarried, under the age of 67, and have looked after and cared for a person who was close to you? If the period of care has now ended, you may be entitled to financial support.

 The period of care must have

 * lasted at least 5 years
* made it impossible for you to work and support yourself during the period of care
* meant that you are unable to support yourself by working after the period of care has ended

 The person you looked after must have been a [member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme](/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme) for at least 5 years by the time the period of care ended. 

 In addition, you must be a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme.

 NAV will assess your wealth and income, and also your needs. You may be entitled to either a pension or transitional benefit.

 The financial support consists of a basic pension and a special supplement. The size of the pension or transitional benefit you can receive depends on how long you have been a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme for.

 The amount of money you receive will be reduced if you have or can be expected to have your own earned income.

 ### Supplemental benefit during education

 If you are in education, or need to move to find work after completing education, you may be entitled to supplemental benefit.

 This also applies if you are registered with NAV as a genuine job seeker.

  ### Allowance to cover tuition fees

 If you are taking an education that NAV has approved, you may be entitled to allowance to cover tuition fees.

 The education must be necessary and appropriate to help you find work or keep your job.

  Financial support for former family caregivers stops 

 * when you turn 67 years old or if you start drawing your old-age pension before the age of 67
* if you are granted disability benefit
* if you get married. However, if you get divorced before two years have passed, you may be entitled to start receiving benefit for former family caregivers again. In this case, you must submit a new application.

 * if you receive a [public sector contractual early retirement pension (AFP](/en/home/benefits-and-services/relatert-informasjon/contractual-early-retirement-pension-afp-in-the-public-sector)). In some cases, you can combine financial support for former family caregivers with a [private sector contractual early retirement pension (AFP](/en/home/benefits-and-services/relatert-informasjon/contractual-early-retirement-pension-afp-in-the-private-sector-from-2011)).

 ### Feriepenger

### Tax deduction

  ### Can I take my pension with me?

 If you move to an EEA country, you will usually be able to continue receiving your pension from the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme.

            ### Moving to Norway

 You can only receive benefit for former family caregivers when you have cared for a person who was close to you who was a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme and lived in Norway.

  You must submit a paper application. It is important that you fill in all the relevant fields and submit all the necessary documentation, so that your case can be processed promptly. You will be notified as you fill in the application if you need to provide documentation of any of the information you have provided.

 The questions in the application, along with any documentation, tell us what we need to know to be able to process your application. We will contact you if we need more information.

 You can [contact NAV](/kontaktoss/en) for more information and guidance, and/or help filling out the application form.

### For persons who are receiving benefit for former family caregivers before 2024

 If you are already receiving this benefit, you will be able to keep it for 3 years. The benefit may be extended by up to 2 years, if you need help finding employment, such as completing an education or work training.

 If you were born in 1969 or earlier and you have had a low earned income for the past five years, you may keep the benefit for 5 years. After that, the pension will be converted to an adjustment allowance, which may entail that your payments change. This benefit is paid until you turn 67 years old.

 ### New rules for survivors from 2024

 The benefit for former family caregivers is being replaced by an adjustment allowance. The allowance is intended to guarantee an income and to help you help yourself in an adjustment period after the death. After 6 months, you will normally be expected to have found employment or be participating in another type of activity, so that you can eventually provide for yourself.

 These changes will likely take effect from 1 January 2024.

 ### What is an adjustment allowance?

 * A time-limited benefit that normally only lasts 3 years.
* The benefit may be extended by up to 2 years, if you need help finding employment, such as completing an education or work training.
* If you were born in 1962 or earlier and you had a low earned income in the last five years before the death, you may keep the benefit until you turn 67 years old.
* The benefit is 2.25 times the National Insurance basic amount G, currently NOK , depending on the period of national insurance coverage for the person who died.
* If your income exceeds 0.5 times G (currently NOK ), the benefit will be reduced.
* The benefit is regarded as pensionable income.
