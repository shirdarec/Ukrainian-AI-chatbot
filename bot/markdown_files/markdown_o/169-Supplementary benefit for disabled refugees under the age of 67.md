#Supplementary benefit for disabled refugees under the age of 67
A guaranteed total income equivalent to the minimum disability benefit when you are both disabled and have refugee status.


You must have refugee status according to section 28 of the Norwegian Immigration Act. You have received this decision from the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration. You must also meet the medical criteria stated in sections 12-4 to 12-7 of the National Insurance Act. You have received this decision from NAV.

 You must have a residence permit and be resident in Norway.

 All income and assets from Norway and abroad are included in the calculations when NAV determines whether you are eligible for supplementary benefit. This also applies to your spouse, co-habiting partner or registered partner.

 If you stay out of Norway for more than 90 days during your benefit period, you will no longer be eligible for supplementary benefit. 

 Supplementary benefit will ensure an income equivalent to the National Insurance Scheme’s minimum disability benefit. The rate you get depends on whether you have a spouse or live alone. 

 ### Holiday pay

 ### Tax

 When you receive supplementary benefit as a disabled refugee, you are entitled to a [concessionary card (in Norwegian)](/honnorkort). The card gives you a discount on public transportation.

 You get the card from NAV without having to ask for it. You will not lose the right to the concessionary card if you have income in addition to the benefit.
