</p>

This demo app made with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) allows users to chat with the [Streamlit docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/) using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)'s Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. By integrating the [Trubrics' Feedback component](https://github.com/trubrics/streamlit-feedback), the app provides a dynamic way to capture user feedback, which is then monitored in [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) for further analyses and improvements.
